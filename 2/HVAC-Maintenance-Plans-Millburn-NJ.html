<h3>Boiler Heating System in Millburn NJ</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
