<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit boost. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
