Improper adjustment, often suggested by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue.

The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
