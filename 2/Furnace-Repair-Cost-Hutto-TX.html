<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
