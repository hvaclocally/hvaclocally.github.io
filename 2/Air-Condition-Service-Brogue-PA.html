<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
