Obviously, too-dry air can also irritate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
