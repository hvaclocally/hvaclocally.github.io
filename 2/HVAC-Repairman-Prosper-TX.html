<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Prosper Texas</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, however to have two significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Whatever heating system you set up, it's essential that it's sized correctly for your house. Too large and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will use excessive energy for the quantity of heat you want produced. If the system is too little, then your home will not be warmed adequately and the system will have to constantly run to try to heat the entire house, which will increase heating costs.<p>

Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by animals and people; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries.
