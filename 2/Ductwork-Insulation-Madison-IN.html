Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
