<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent informing me about our system, and left having fixed the problem with a basic repair he did on-site, not replacing the entire part. He got along, simple and a thoroughly satisfying individual to have around that entire time. His time and knowledge to RESOLVE the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a somewhat unsure diagnostic.<p>
<p>For example, pollutants might gather within the air diffusers and grills, presenting toxins into the environment. Or if the outside air intake lies near a source of moisture or other outside pollutant, it might serve as a path to bring the impurities inside.

An abrupt shift in temperature level from warm to cold can also an asthma attack.<p>
<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted 2 local companies for quotes. While both were helpful and handy, Ballard Natural Gas gave us a much better offer, for exceptional service. Instead of an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heater and located methods we might have more even heat. He consisted of these small but considerable changes in his quote. Because of current warmer summers and for environmental reasons, we chose to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
