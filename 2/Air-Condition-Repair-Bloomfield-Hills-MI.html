<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release pollutants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
