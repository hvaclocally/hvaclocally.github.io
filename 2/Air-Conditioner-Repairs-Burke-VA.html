<h3>AC Technician in Burke VA</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent chance; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency security switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on rare occasions.<p>
