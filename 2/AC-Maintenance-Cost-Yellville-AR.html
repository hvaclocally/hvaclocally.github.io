<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can become blocked with debris that can limit airflow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down completely. By comparison, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can typically be performed in just a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to offer car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There ought to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
