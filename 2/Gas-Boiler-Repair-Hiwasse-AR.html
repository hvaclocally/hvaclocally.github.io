<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners.

While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the exact same).

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
