<p>Geothermal heat pumps are extremely efficient, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is constantly at a constant temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other kinds of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates just how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling effect.
