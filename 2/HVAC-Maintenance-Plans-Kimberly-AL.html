<h3>What to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in Kimberly AL</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on various home performance upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to help us debate which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's services and products was remarkable. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to carry out the needed electrical enhancements to save on cost.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it really rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
