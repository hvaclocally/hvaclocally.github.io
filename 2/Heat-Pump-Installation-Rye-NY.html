<p>While individuals invest 90% of their time inside, indoor air quality has not been a large focus of attention for facilities management and occupants until recently. The coronavirus outbreak is bringing indoor air quality into the spotlight as medical facilities work to reduce the spread of disease and workplaces, retail, and education facilities are thinking about strategies to reopen safely and reduce infection.<p>
<p>Plenty of HVAC companies will price out things like specialized filter changes during Preventative Maintenance visits, individually, as an add on service for you. No 2 systems are exactly the very same, but filter modifications are something we provide throughout PM check outs if the client requires it- particularly the inaccessible filters- since we know how essential it is that they be altered out & how hard it can be for a homeowner to do it.<p>

<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is sincere, reputable, and affordable on price. It's hard to find a sincere AC person and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Brian was every bit honest, pleasant and responsive. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing technician discussed our alternatives prior to our deal with Brian and was extraordinary, useful and helpful - his work was remarkable!

<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ might observe moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
