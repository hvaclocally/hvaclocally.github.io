<p>The bureau jobs 34 percent work growth for HVAC specialists in between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all professions. A number of factors add to this, including the replacement and upgrade of older a/c systems to fulfill stricter environmental regulations. The slow rebound in residential and industrial construction will produce a stable circulation of new opportunities, especially for service technicians who are willing to transfer. New systems are more electronic and advanced, so service technicians who have finished official training programs at a technical or community college might have a benefit over those who find out on the task.<p>
<p>If the AC does not turn off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
