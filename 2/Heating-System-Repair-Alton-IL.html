<p>Due to the fact that they remove wetness from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To deal with condensate issues, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
