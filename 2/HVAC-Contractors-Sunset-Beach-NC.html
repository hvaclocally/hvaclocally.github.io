<p>Poor indoor air quality is typically caused by the absence of sufficient ventilation, which results in a buildup of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the main issue in more than half the workplace indoor air investigations it has performed.
