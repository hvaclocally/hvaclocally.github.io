But according to a cybersecurity expert at a big seller who asked not to be named because he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a group that regularly keeps an eye on energy consumption and temperature levels in stores to save on costs (especially at night) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the stores vary outside of an appropriate range that could prevent consumers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Filters can get filthy quickly, particularly if you reside in a location that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, debris, bacteria, and clean the air.
