<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
