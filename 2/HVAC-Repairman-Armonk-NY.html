<h3>AC Service in Armonk NY</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
