An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
