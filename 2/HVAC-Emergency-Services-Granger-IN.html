<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years earlier and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
