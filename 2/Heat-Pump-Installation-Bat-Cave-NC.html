Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well.

The best central air conditioning conditioner you can buy today will use 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while providing the exact same amount of cooling.<p>
