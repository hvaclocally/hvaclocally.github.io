<p>The very first a/c and refrigerators used flammable or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside your home.
