<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should look out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
