<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in gathering details on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to temporarily manage the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
