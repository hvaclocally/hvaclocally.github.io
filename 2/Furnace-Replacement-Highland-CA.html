<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractors in Highland</h2>

<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the right temperature level.

If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
