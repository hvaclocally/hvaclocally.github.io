<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
