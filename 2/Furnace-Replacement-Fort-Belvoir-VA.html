In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary environmental threat to the health of kids in the United States." There are numerous ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, degrading paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled, Airborne lead gets in the body. Prior to it was understood how harmful lead might be, it was used in paint, fuel, pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
