<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

The two operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to attain its aims.<p>
