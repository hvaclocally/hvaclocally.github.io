<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly decreases direct exposure to pollutants during cooking. Improper modification, frequently shown by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame suggestion is blue. If you purchase a brand-new gas range or range, think about buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot burner that burns continuously.
