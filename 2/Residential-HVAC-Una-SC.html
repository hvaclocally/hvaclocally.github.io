<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Una South Carolina</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the see. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the new part.
