These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions call for.

Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
