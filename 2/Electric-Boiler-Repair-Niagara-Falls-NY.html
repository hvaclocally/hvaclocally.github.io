<h3>Gas Furnace Repair in Niagara Falls New York</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00.

<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good main heater.
