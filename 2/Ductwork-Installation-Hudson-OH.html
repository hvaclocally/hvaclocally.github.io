<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Hudson OH?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his evaluation, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be correctly vented and cleaned from the furnace frequently. Change the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned since the soot builds up inside the ducts, decreasing their performance gradually. Anticipate to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>

<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Because it is impossible to see, taste or smell, CO can eliminate you before you are aware it is in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes mild impacts that are frequently mistaken for the influenza. These symptoms include headaches, dizziness, queasiness, fatigue and disorientation. The effects of CO direct exposure can differ greatly from individual to individual depending upon age, overall health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
