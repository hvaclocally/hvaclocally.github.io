<p>If you set it too low, you're motivating the growth of mold in moist air. The heat dries out the air, avoiding mold growth and pollution. Of course, too-dry air can also aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can add to the development of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
