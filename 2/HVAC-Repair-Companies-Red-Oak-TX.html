<p>A third method to choose whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities.

Indications that can indicate your house may not have sufficient ventilation consist of wetness condensation on windows or walls, smelly or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become musty.

<p>In some cases a temporary indoor air quality issue is created just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded conference area.
