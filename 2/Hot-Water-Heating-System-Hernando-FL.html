<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Hernando FL Home Owners</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters.

For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
