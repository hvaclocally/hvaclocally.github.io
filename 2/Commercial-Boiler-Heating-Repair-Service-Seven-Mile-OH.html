<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
