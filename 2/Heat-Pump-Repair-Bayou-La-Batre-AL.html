<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>This in floor heating unit consists of one thin continuous cable television heating aspect woven into a mat that you set up under the tile.

<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. When the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats.

Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
