<p>The function of many structure ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for resident comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing security at reasonable energy costs. Your furnace has many elements that can affect the health and safety of you and your loved ones. Having a complete check of your furnace will supply assurance that it is safe to operate.
