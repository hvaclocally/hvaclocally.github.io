Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually seen the single-family house installation service totally turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not simply with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices normally lasts decades, since it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up.
