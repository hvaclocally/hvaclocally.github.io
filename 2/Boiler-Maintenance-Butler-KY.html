<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and thus requires conditions appropriate for both organisms. The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, consisting of chlorine. Remediation for Legionella break outs in commercial structures differ, but frequently include extremely hot water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and in some cases flushes of heavy metal salts.

Nevertheless, considering that all components of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat is removed. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is in fact heated, simply as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
