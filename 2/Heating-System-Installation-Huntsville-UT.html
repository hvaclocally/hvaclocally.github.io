<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Huntsville UT?</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipelines installed under the floor or right within the flooring surface area itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and individuals. It does not rely on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
