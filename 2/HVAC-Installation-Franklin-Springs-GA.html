<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Franklin Springs GA</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most economical. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
