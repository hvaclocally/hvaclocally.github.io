<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System since of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are used to seeing this enter the backyards of houses. With split system units, most of the parts are housed in a metal box outside of the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal parts as well. Split systems are perfect for cooling several rooms simultaneously, however are not extremely energy effective. For that reason, one pro is not having loud devices in the home. At the exact same time, the con would be that those who utilize this may spend more money on cooling costs in the long run because of the lower energy effectiveness.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
