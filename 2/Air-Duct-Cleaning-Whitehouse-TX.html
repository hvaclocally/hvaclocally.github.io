<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
