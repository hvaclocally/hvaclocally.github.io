<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
