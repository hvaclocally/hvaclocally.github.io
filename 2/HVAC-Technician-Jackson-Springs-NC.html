<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a different split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, since some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works however the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
