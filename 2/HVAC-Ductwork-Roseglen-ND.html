<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside unit as near the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
