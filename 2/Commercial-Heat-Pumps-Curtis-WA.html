<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the higher temperatures often used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to supply thermal comfort inside. However, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities generate mold development and moisture indoors is associated with a greater prevalence of resident breathing issues.<p>
