<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
