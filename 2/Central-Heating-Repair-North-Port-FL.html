<p>These guys have been fantastic. At a real estate agent, I sometimes need contractors to offer me an opinion for what deal with a house might cost. Recently I needed to contact these people twice.

<p>In addition to getting the huge photo" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be set up to supply threshold notifies. If, for instance, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could establish your tracking equipment to notify you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the proper action to resolve the scenario instantly.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, but it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have an unfavorable effect on residents-- outdoors air must be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
