<p>At present, EPA does not recommend utilizing air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay products. The efficiency of these gadgets is uncertain since they only partly eliminate the radon decay products and do not decrease the quantity of radon getting in the house. EPA plans to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a trustworthy means of lowering the health threat from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, supplies additional information on air-cleaning gadgets to decrease indoor air toxins.<p>

<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals released as gases from products or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
