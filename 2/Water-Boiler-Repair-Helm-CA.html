<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a service was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to build business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the exact same in all other locations.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
