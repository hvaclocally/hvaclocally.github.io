<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the a/c into a heatpump While space cooling provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is normally more costly than central air.<p>
