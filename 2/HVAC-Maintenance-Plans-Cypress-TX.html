<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Cypress TX?</h3>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
