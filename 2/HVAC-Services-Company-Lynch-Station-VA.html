<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Lynch Station VA</h3>

As a first step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2.

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
