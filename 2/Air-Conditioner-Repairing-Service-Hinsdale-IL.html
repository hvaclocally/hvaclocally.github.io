<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
