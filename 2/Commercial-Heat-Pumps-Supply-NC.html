<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely happy that someone as experienced as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.)

We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
