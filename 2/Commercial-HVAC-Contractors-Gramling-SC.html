<p>Particular immediate effects are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically tough to determine if the symptoms are an outcome of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is very important to pay attention to the time and place the signs occur. If the symptoms fade or disappear when an individual is away from the home and return when the person returns, an effort should be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts may be worsened by an insufficient supply of outdoor air or from the cooling, heating, or humidity conditions prevalent in the house.<p>
<p>In a location where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. If temperatures reach and drop below freezing, your heating technician can set up controls which instantly shut down the heat pump. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
