<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>These guys have actually been fantastic. At a real estate agent, I often need contractors to offer me an opinion for what deal with a house might cost. Just recently I required to get in touch with these men twice. They came out quickly and gave me a no nonsense estimate for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Integrity isn't simply their name, its a company design they take seriously. You guys are formally on speed dial. Speak to you quickly.<p>

<h3>Choosing the Ideal HVAC System For The Job in Gualala CA</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it really rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
