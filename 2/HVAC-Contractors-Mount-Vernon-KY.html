<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle.
