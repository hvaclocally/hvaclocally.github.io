<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may go into nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
