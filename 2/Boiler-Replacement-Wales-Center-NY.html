<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
