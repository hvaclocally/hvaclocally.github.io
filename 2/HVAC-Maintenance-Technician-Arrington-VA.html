<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
