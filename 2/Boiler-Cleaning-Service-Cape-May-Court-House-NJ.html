<p>Remember that the SEER ranking is computed using the very same set of temperature levels across the board. The typical summer season temperature to arrive at the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to get to the right SEER ranking for your area, deduct 2 points for every single 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER rating needs to be at least 13 for all new cooling units manufactured in the United States.<p>
<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living centers, medium to big industrial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and healthcare facilities, lorries such as automobiles, trains, planes, submarines and ships, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are managed with regard to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your house that perfect temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those common air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause costly repairs down the road. So, be sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service plan which generally consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
