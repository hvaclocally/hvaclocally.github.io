<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
