<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
