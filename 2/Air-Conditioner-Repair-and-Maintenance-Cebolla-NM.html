<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating devices can last for several years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel expenses unexpectedly seem higher than normal, it is most likely time to think about a brand-new system. New heating equipment is even more effective-- you'll see lower fuel costs immediately, not to mention the money you'll minimize repair expenses. You can most likely expect to cut your fuel bills in half if your heating system is 25 years old or more.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>The use of air filters can trap a few of the air toxins. The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable Energy section suggests that "Air Filtering must have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to lower the amount of dust that reaches the damp coils.
