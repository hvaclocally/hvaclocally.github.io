<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been correctly dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
