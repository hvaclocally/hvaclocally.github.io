<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
