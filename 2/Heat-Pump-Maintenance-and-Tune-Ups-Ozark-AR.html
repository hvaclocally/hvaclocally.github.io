<p>Measurement procedures are being developed and shown to examine building ventilation and indoor contaminant concentrations. These procedures range from advanced tracer gas methods utilized mainly in building research efforts to less involved procedures that can be employed by constructing operators. NIST scientists are constantly developing brand-new test procedures, and after that demonstrating them in the field to assess their expediency and dependability. The efforts in which these treatments are shown in the field has led to the advancement of an essential database of building ventilation and indoor air quality efficiency.<p>
<p>Indoor air pollution comes from a range of sources; the US Epa (EPA) has identified building materials, home furnishings, and mold as serious concerns, but much of the danger also comes from burning things. For instance, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop pollution in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly big concern in the developing world.<p>
<p>Finally, if you do identify an especially energy-efficient in-floor heating system and pick to install it in your home, you could be qualified for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor costs. (And these costs can be considerable. According to figures gathered by Angie's List, house owners can expect to pay between $6 and $16 per square foot, not consisting of tax and labor, for a radiant heating system.) Seek Advice From the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Rewards for Renewable Resource (DSIRE) to see if there are rebates, loans or tax deductions available for the installation of a more effective in-floor heater where you live.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, typically referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floors, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioner to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
