<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Van Orin IL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
