The standards do not require you to change your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services must still be offered for your house's systems.

<p>Fact: Federal and local rewards normally amount to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial rate of a system competitive with traditional devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, throughout brand-new building and construction (houses generally utilize between one and five loads). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. Nevertheless, brand-new installation practices are reducing expenses, to the point where the cost is getting closer to traditional systems under the best conditions.<p>
