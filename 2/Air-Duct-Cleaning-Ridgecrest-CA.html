<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be extreme. They consist of hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Babies, fetuses, and kids are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults since lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Children might have higher exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>

<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard job that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.
