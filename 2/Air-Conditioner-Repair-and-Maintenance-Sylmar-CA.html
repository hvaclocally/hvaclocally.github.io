<p>Normally the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is frequently important to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such information can in some cases be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If monitoring data is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative must request that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Evaluation of this data may recognize possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when pollutant concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on information may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
