<p>The purpose of a lot of structure ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for occupant convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing security at reasonable energy expenses. Load calculating is referred to as the Handbook J computation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or system cost for air conditioning. If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based upon experience or on square video footage alone, move to another contractor.

<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
