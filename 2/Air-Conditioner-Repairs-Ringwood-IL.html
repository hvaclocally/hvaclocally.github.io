<p>In the last several years, a growing body of clinical evidence has suggested that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outdoor air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research study shows that people spend roughly 90 percent of their time inside. Hence, for lots of people, the threats to health might be higher due to exposure to air contamination inside your home than outdoors.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
