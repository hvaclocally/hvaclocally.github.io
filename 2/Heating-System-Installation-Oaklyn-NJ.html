<p>Re-install the access panel and detach block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan ought to spin. If the compressor begins but the fan does not, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan begins. , if it does not, you have actually provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
