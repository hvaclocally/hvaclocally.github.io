<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
