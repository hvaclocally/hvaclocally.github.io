<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

<p>The first air conditioning system and fridges employed combustible or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could result in fatal mishaps when they leaked.

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
