That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
