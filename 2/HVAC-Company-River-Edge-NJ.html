The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the new control panel should be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.

Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
