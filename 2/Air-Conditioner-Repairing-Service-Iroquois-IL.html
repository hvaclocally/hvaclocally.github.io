<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the appropriate temperature. Furnaces that kick on often may be due to a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>
