<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Unionville VA Home</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in house building is to minimize air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, floors, and roofing systems. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
