<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Yatesville GA</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or changing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and excessive wetness, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior building air flowing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
