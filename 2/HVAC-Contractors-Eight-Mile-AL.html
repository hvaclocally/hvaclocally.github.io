<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of affordable ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex correctly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install team was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the expected amount of time. post install examination outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the system has been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
