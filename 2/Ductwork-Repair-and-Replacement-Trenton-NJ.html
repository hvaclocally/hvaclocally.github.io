<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on.

Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ might discover moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy.

Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>

The effects of CO exposure can differ considerably from person to individual depending upon age, overall health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
