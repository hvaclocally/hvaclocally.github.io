<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me priority and a lower rate.

Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
