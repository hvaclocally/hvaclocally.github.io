<h3>HVAC Repair Quotes in Birmingham Alabama</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<h3>Heating System Installation in Birmingham AL</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>

<p>Just a professional can accurately diagnose why your furnace isn't starting. If at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something seems strange or you lose self-confidence, it's time to call an expert. Similarly, if the procedure does not work, something else is incorrect and you require a technician to analyze the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you find you need to do it often, it's probably time for an expert opinion.<p>
