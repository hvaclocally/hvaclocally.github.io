<h3>HVAC Repair Quotes in Germantown TN</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>

When they are dealt with in a way that produces dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be breathed in, these products present a threat only. When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or interrupted by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can become airborne if proper controls are not in location. This can lead to the potential for substantial health issue.<p>
