Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
