Natural or mechanical ventilation methods do not remove them from the air in your home as quickly as they develop up since cigarette smoking produces such large quantities of pollutants. In addition, the big boosts in ventilation it requires to considerably reduce exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can likewise increase energy expenses significantly. As a result, the most efficient method to reduce exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the house is to eliminate smoking cigarettes there.<p>
