<p>A homeowner can successfully learn to do a project such as bleeding and restarting an oil furnace, but you should be confident that you know what you're doing. People who are experienced with such diy projects will probably have the ability to bleed the furnace without too much of a problem.

<p>Air contaminants can vary from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air contaminant arising from gas that escapes into your house without being burnt. Older houses might contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchen areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where moisture levels are generally greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Residents of houses with bad indoor air quality might complain of signs such as headache, eye inflammation, tiredness, dry throat, sinus blockage, dizziness, and queasiness. Since many diseases can trigger these symptoms, diagnosing sick structure syndrome is hard. Extremely high levels of some pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, can trigger more serious illness, including death.<p>
