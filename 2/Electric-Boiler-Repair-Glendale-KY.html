<h3>Appropriate Things To Consider In Your Glendale KY Commercial HVAC Service Provider</h3>
<p>The majority of people understand that outdoor air contamination can impact their health, but indoor air pollution can likewise have significant, damaging impact. EPA studies of human direct exposure to air contaminants suggest that indoor levels of contaminants might be two to five times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board consistently rank indoor air contamination amongst the top 5 ecological health threats to the general public.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
