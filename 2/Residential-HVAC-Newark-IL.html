<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Since it tires warm air out the top, don't put the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it. Any air flow limitation will lower the unit's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. A good location to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's kind of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there have not troubled with it!
