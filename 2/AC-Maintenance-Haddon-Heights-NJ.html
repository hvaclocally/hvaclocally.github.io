<p>In-floor heating systems can come with particular health advantages. The hotter the air, the drier it becomes. On those days when you simply can't seem to warm up and discover you require to show up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses throbbing. Since they heat surfaces and not the air itself, in-floor heating systems are not prone to this concern.

The minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
