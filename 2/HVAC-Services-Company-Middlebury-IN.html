There can be a serious danger from the cumulative results of these sources.

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled.
