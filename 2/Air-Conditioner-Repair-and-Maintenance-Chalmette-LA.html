<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a distribution system. Metal pipes are rarely used due to long-term corrosive issues. Practically all hydronic glowing floor heat systems today utilize 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is extremely versatile, will not rust and is available in long lengths, which permit PEX pipeline to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
