<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heater, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles.

In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
