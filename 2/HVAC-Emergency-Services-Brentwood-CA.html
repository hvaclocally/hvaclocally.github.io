<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have.
