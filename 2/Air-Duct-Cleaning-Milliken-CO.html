It is likewise their duty to inform employees of the instant risks that are present.Specific state and local guidelines may apply.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not offer them.  Second of all like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ.
