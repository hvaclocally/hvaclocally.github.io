Their techs are extremely educated and professional. Costs are sensible. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their method.

Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature level, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
