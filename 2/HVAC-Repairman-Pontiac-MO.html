<p>Both must be kept clean because an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>The main factor homeowners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the quantity of services offered.

<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues.
