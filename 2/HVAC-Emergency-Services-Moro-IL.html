<p>We're Not Simply Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to look out for is the dust that gathers throughout summertimes. The very best thing to do is ensuring that the heater burners are inspected and cleaned up completely prior to cooler seasons begin.

<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>
