<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Since it just takes more electricity to run a larger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness.
