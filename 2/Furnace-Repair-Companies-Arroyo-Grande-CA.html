Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried.
