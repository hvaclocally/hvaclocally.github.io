<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roofing, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, however it is likewise a choice for property owners to think about. Many times, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost.

For that reason, this might not be the best option for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
