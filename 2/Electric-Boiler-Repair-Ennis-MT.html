<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>
