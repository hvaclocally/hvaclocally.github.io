<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely useful in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to briefly manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
