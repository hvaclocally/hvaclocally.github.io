<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

A standard air conditioning system transfers heat out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside.

Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is really heated, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
