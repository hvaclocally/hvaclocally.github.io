<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards normally amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial rate of a system competitive with standard devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout new building and construction (homes typically use between one and five loads).
