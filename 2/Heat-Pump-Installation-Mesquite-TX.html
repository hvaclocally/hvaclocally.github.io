<h3>Designing Tips to Central Heating Systems at Mesquite TX</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different home efficiency upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's items and services was remarkable. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to perform the essential electrical improvements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
