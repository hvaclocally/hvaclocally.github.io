<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
