<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy effective methods of heating or cooling a home. Relying on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be heated up in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found just a couple of feet below ground.

<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works however your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 need to be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
