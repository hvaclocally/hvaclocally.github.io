<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
