<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner at Decatur AL</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment.

The crew took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We decided on getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy costs. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
