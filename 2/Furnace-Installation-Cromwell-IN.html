<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Because as much as 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in performance advantage. Since they do not need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Because an unit is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
