<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
