Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
