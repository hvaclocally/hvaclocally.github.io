<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, because the system is integrated.

For that reason, this may not be the very best alternative for property owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
