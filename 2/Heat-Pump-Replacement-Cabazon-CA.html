Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
