<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
