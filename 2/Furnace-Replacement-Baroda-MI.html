I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
