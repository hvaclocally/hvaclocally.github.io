<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
