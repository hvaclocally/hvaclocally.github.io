<p>The first air conditioners and refrigerators used hazardous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
<h3>Boiler Installation in Paramount California</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the check out. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was very happy they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will absolutely be utilizing them once again.<p>

<h3>HVAC Technician Near Me in Paramount CA</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they identified the issue and repaired really quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
