<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
