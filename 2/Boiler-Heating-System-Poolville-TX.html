<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Health Problem (BRI) describes less frequent (but typically more major) cases of individuals ending up being ill after remaining in a specific building at a certain time. In these cases, there is typically a similar set of clinical signs experienced by the people and a clear cause can frequently be discovered upon investigation. Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI caused by bacteria which can contaminate a structure's a/c system.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in performance advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Because they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Because an unit is installed in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
