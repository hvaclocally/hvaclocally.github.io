I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Central air conditioners, typically described as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floorings, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning system to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
