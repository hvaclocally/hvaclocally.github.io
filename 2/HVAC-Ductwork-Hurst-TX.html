<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts years, since it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to install.

In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
