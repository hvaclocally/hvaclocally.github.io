<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Through regular use and the unit's presence outside, the coils and fins of the a/c may become very unclean. These aspects of the equipment are crucial for efficient air conditioning. The technician cleans up all elements, and inspects connections to ensure they are secure. The system is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic elements are examineded for correct function and general condition. This is an excellent chance to recognize parts that are worn or malfunctioning. Changing them to fix the cooling may be a lot less costly when the issue is reasonably small.<p>
