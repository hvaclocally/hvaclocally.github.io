<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging direct exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is poorly gotten rid of from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in homes can also arise from lead dust from outdoor sources, including contaminated soil tracked within, and use of lead in particular indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
