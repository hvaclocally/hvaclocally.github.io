The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Invest in education and training: HVAC is not "rule of thumb" work, and no 2 homes are the same. When service technicians are properly trained, they select and install effective, safe equipment.

Founders and supervisors ought to likewise remain abreast of progressing technologies and market best practices.<p>
