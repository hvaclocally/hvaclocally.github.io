Pressed wood products produced indoor usage include: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furnishings); wood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).
