"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price terrific however Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>Designing Tips to Central Heating Systems in Ottawa Lake MI</h3>
<p>A split air conditioning system might cost near that of a traditional HVAC system but has proven to be an alternative cost reliable alternative to homes that do not have ductwork. Used in addition to other forms of heating or cooling, such as portable or window air conditioners, space heating units, or oil heaters, it can boost the convenience of your home while keeping your regular monthly utility costs affordable.<p>
<p>There's a huge difference in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common kind of home heating-- convection. Over the previous century, most of houses in colder climates were heated up by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the floorings, ceilings and walls heated up. In turn, the items in the room, like furniture and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>

Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
