<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
