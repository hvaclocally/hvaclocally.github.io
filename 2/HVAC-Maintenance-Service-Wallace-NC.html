Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
