<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, considering that it is safeguarded inside. When it does require to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to set up.

<p>While contaminants commonly discovered in indoor air are responsible for lots of hazardous results, there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are needed to produce specific illness. Individuals likewise react extremely differently to direct exposure to indoor air contaminants.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
