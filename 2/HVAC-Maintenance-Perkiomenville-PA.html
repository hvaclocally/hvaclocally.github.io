<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, offices and schools matters, especially because we spend the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioning unit assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in very damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is oversized, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your home. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. For that reason, an expert service person should be required nearly any maintenance other than routine cleaning. Central air conditioners must be professionally examined and changed before the start of every cooling season. However, don't let your maintenance end with this yearly checkup. While there aren't lots of repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system running at peak efficiency.<p>

<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was type of odd being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was very lite weight and takes time to use. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with concerns. I would suggest this product to anybody who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
