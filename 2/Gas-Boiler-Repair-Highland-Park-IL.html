The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Open windows or use exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common technique of reducing direct exposure to indoor air pollutants, also will reduce however not get rid of direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke. Due to the fact that cigarette smoking produces such big amounts of contaminants, mechanical or natural ventilation techniques do not eliminate them from the air in your home as quickly as they develop.
