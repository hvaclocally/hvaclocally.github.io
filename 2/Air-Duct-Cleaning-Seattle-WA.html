<p>Specialist heater setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately fail. HVAC professionals advise following this standard rule when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
<p>A Trane a/c unit can vary in rate from $4,000 - $10,000. Our rates guide describes all the elements that impact your price.
