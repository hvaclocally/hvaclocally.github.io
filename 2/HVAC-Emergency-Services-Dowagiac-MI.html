The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future.

<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was required and renovated the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater since the technicians believed they simply didn't seem best and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
