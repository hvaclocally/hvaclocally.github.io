<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
