<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a distribution system. Metal pipes are hardly ever used due to long-term destructive concerns.
