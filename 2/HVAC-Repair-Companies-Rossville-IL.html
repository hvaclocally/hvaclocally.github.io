<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance identify the efficiency of dilution.

There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this.
