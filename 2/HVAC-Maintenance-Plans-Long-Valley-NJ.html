<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical material in time.

Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
