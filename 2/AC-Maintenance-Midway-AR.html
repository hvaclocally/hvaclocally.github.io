<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>I am very impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years ago and understand the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is likewise a choice for homeowners to think about. Often times, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, considering that the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best option for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
