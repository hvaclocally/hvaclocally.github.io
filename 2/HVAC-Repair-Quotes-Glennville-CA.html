<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may go into nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
