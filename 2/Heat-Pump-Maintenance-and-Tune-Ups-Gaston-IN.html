<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are exceptionally effective, since ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is always at a continuous temperature. These systems can attain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates just how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling effect. Many ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the kind of heat.<p>
<p>Check these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
