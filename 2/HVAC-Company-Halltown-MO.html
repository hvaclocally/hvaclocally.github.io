<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues in homes. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>For instance, issues occur when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate sufficient quantities of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation also occurs if the air supply and return vents within each space are blocked or put in such a method that outdoor air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of structure residents. Improperly situated outside air consumption vents can also bring in air polluted with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological impurities that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>
