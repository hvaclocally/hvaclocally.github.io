<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a service was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC entrepreneur should strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
