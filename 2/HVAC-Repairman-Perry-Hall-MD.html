<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

He also reacted to my call right away the next morning, and coached me through a short-term repair to a problem that couldn't be resolved on the first check out due to not available parts. I trust Nick's abilities, experience and capability to deliver consistent, quality service.<p>
