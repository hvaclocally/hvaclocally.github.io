<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
