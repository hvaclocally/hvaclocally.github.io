<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils.

It likewise prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
