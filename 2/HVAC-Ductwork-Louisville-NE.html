Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
