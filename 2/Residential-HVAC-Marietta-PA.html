This is typically utilized in a third-floor or 2nd area and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
