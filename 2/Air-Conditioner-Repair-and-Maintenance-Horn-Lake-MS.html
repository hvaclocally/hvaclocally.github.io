The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power needs to not go beyond the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units higher than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, because the total capability of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside unit.

<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types.
