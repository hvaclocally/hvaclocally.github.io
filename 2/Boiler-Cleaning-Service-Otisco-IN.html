<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
