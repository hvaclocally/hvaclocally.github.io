<h3>Heat Pump Repair in Cuyahoga Falls Ohio</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, however to have 2 significant parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee.
