<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service several years back and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running.
