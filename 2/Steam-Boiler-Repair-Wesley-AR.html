<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to offer enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
