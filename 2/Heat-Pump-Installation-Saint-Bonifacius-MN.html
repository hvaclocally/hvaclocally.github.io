<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
