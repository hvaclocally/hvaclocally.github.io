<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
