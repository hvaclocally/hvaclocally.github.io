<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>In 2011, NASA watched for an air conditioning system to install in their lunar electric rover. They decided they required professional aid and sought advice from various suppliers.
