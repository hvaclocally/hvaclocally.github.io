<p>I normally don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
