<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
