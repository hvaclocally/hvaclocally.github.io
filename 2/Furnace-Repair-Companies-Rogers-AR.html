While you can definitely buy your furnace yourself, most contractors won't warranty the furnace or might not install it if you don't purchase it from them.

Our group does outstanding work, whether it's managing standard HVAC work or handling the quirks of brownstones, other structures and prewar buildings hard to heat or cool.<p>

However, some producers need routine maintenance as a regard to the service warranty.<p>
