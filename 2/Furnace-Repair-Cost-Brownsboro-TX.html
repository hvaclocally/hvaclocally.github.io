<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most economical. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Though it may be difficult to think, the air inside your house can be worse than the air outside.

VOCs (unpredictable natural compounds) from paint and even from some kinds of carpeting and upholstery products can trigger problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>

Call us today and believe in your a/c all summer season long.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside should be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
