<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
