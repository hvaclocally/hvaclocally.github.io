<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct.

When the air conditioning system works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service many years earlier and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Practically half of Americans utilize air fresheners a minimum of as soon as a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that often, our nationally representative survey discovered. Approximately 40 percent seldom or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen area range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
