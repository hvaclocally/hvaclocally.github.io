<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my services, my own houses and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he assisted me trouble shoot the issue. He is sincere, trusted, and affordable on rate. It's hard to find an honest AC guy and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that may impact the health of individuals who reside in the house. Contaminants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant might likewise originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unpredictable organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care products. Viruses and germs, pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Generally the most reliable method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants.
