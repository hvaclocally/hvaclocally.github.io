<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
