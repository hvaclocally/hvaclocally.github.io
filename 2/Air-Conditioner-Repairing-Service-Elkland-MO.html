<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
