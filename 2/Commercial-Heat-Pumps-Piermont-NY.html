<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>In addition, employee health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, irritation, and irregular breathing may be brought on as the result of temperature level extremes, improper humidity levels, and insufficient or too much air flow. Office temperatures must be preserved between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by excessive air circulation should be avoided.<p>
<p>Usually the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more affordable method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
