<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
