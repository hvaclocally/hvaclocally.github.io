We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.

<p>Think about potential results of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit.

A relentless yellow-tipped flame is normally a sign of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While an area heating system is in usage, open a door from the space where the heating unit lies to the remainder of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
