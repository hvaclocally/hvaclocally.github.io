<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
