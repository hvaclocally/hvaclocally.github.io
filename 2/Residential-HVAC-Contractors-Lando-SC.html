<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
