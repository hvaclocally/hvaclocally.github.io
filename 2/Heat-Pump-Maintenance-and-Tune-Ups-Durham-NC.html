A/c unit assist to dehumidify the inbound air, however in extremely humid climates or in cases where the ac system is extra-large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your home.

You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results via a dashboard, which turns the data into visual charts that are simple to understand.<p>
