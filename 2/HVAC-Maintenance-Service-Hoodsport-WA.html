<p>The purpose of many structure ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing safety at sensible energy costs.

<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that may affect the health of individuals who live in the house. Toxins might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground below. An air toxin could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or personal care items. Germs and viruses, animal dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
