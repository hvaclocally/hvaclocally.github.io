Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
