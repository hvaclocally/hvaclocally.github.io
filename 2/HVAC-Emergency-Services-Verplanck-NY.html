<p>If you operate in construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your hobby includes lead, you may unwittingly bring lead into your house on your clothing or hands.

Soil by highways and roads might be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from automobiles and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to wipe your feet before getting in the home. If you work with lead in your job or a hobby, change your clothing before you go house and wash these clothes independently. Motivate your children to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirt which stays with toys and fingers. Attempt to keep your kids from eating dirt, and make certain they wash their hands when they come within.<p>
