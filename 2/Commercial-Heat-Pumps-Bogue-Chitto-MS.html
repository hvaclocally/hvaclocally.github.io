<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Ensure all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
