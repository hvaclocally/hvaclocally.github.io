<p>Even if you don't feel unclean, pollen clings to your hair and clothes where it can easily irritate your nose and eyes, and contribute to indoor air contamination. Don't have time for a fast rinse?

<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heating unit. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. If temperature levels reach and drop below freezing, your heating technician can install controls which automatically shut down the heat pump. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
<p>We have been exceptionally delighted with Stability's devices (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten completed yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heatpump has worked extremely well and is so effective that it considerably reduced our utility expenses - the system will pay for itself in less than 5 years. The couple of times we have needed them for emergencies they responded rapidly and fixed the issue.<p>
