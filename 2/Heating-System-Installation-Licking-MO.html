<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Licking MO?</h3>
<p>If you need furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to order it. My partner stated that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most decent individuals I have met in a long time.
