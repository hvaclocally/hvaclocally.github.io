<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
