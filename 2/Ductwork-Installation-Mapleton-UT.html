Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by performing at lower or higher capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air conditioning system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's a/c are more energy efficient than models made 5 years earlier, so it makes financial sense to replace or update your system if it's 5 years of ages or older. The very best central air conditioner you can purchase today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one acquired in 1975 while delivering the same quantity of cooling.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
