<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor devices through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>

These examinations may start with composed surveys and telephone assessments in which building investigators assess the history of resident signs and structure operation procedures. In many cases, these inquiries might quickly uncover the problem and on-site visits are unneeded.<p>
<p>I am really impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years back and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
