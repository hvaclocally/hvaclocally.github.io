<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Maintenance in Wingina VA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
