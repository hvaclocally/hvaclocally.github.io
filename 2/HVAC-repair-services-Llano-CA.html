(See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.)

<p>We advise utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete pieces. When used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money. They shows the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of allowing heat to warm up the concrete piece below.

<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You might look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capacity and efficiency if you already have a home heating system. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to try to find a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters.

However, assuming they are installed correctly and properly taken care of, the likelihood of them having problems is little.<p>
