<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a recommendation later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
