<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar concepts.

In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
