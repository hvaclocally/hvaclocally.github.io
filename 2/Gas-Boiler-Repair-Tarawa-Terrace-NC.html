<h3>The Benefits of Buying A New Furnace at Tarawa Terrace NC</h3>

In many cases it is due to bad furnace design, but oftentimes, it's from overlook.

Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
