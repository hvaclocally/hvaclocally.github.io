The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my organisations, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, reputable, and sensible on rate. It's hard to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
