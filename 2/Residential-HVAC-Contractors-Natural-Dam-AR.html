<p>Although installation is simple and does not require much time, trying this task is not a great concept.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>

The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
