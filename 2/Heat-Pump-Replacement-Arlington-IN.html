<h3>Best Heat Pump in Arlington Indiana</h3>
<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is frosty, the evaporator coil is most likely frozen. Likewise, if the a/c unit smells bad, there might be bacteria accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat away from your house. It will draw from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the a/c's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is even more than other heat pump types when setting up the entire system. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Setting up one included excavation, running hundreds of lawns of piping, burying the loop, and more. This procedure is quite costly. Installing a new geothermal heat pump to work with an existing ground loop is far more affordable.<p>
