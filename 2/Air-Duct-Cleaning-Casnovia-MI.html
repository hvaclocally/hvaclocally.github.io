I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
