Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank.

If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have actually to be cut.<p>
