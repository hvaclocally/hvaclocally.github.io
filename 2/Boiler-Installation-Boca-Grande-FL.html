<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the very same. Once the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly solidify and treat-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
