All wiring for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>We recommend utilizing our insulation boards when setting up over concrete pieces.
