<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues.

If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
