Today's furnaces are rated 90% effectiveness or better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which might be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can indicate significant savings in annual heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase performance even further by performing at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Air ducts are accountable for dispersing cold and hot air throughout your home, offering a comfortable environment in every room.
