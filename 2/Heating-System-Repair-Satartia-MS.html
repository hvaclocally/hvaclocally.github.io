The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system are similar to those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank need to be looked for leakages, the system should be flushed occasionally to get rid of tank and gathered impurities (scaling in difficult water areas).

The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to remove dust collected in order to enhance collector efficiency.<p>
