<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Good AC Repair Company at Sonoma CA</h3>
<p>MAINTENANCE PLANS: Your HVAC system is an investment that pays for itself throughout the years, however just if you protect it to the very best of your capability. Luckily, this doesn't need to be a task! When you sign up for a Keefe's maintenance strategy, we look after whatever. No matter what make or model of cooling or heating system you own, even if it's a zone control system, you'll get semi-annual evaluations, discounted diagnostics, top priority service, and fantastic deals on repairs and replacements.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
