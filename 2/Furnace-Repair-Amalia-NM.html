<p>The exhaust outlets permit all hazardous gases to escape your home so there's no dangerous buildup of carbon monoxide gas and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are obstructed, they can lead to a harmful build-up and compromise your security.

<p>Filters can get unclean quickly, particularly if you live in an area that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, debris, bacteria, and tidy the air. They're responsible for preserving the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and changed routinely, your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you expect it to. The cooling and heating will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will aggravate. Inspecting and changing the air filters is one of the most essential aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues.
