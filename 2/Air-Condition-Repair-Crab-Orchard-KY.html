<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<h3>Air Condition System in Crab Orchard KY</h3>

Many basic systems break down after simply four hours of severe vibration screening, while the Vigorous II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel top plate offers long lasting strength while long copper lines reduce vibration and, for that reason, sound too. While being one of the hardest a/c around, its 410A refrigerant is kinder to the environment. Robust, capable and lightweight of performing in any environment! It will not let you down.<p>

<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years earlier and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
