<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>

<h3>Getting Through Central Heating Installation in East Irvine CA</h3>
<p>Elements that can contribute to the development of biological pollutants are damp or wet structure products (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and improperly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and ac system. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Numerous fungi and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these contaminants can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are pets and family plants.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
