Heat pumps work on electrical power and work like air conditioning system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in place. In addition, the concrete results of a PM is often difficult to quantify, as one response stated the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not just break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the result of repeated use of a component that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature deterioration, resulting in cracks and holes. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the element.  a really useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
