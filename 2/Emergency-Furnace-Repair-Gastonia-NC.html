<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Companies in Gastonia</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
