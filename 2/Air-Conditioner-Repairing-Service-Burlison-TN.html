<p>Immediate discount rates on high-efficiency heat pump innovations are readily available to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Excellent Client Service! Climate Pro is trusted and genuinely appreciated us and our situation. We got home one night to a cold house. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came by that same night. Although he didn't have actually the required replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could look for and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely appreciative to have a heated house again. What's most fantastic was that this all taken place during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right prior to a holiday, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
