<p>Technicians who specialize in brand-new installation work may experience durations of unemployment when the level of brand-new building and construction activity decreases.

However, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
