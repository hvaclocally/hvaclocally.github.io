<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter.

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you must watch out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
