<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Greensboro FL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
