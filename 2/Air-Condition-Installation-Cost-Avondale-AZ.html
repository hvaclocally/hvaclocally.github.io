<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
