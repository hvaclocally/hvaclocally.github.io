<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could flatter two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's due to the fact that it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER.

Momentarily increasing ventilation coupled with correct usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be useful in watering down the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
