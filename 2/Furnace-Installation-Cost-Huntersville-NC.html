<p>Iâ $ m actually fussy with my stuff. I like my equipment and devices original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with inexpensive knock-offs. So purchasing this a/c unit to replace my old one was somewhat of a challenging fact. You canâ $ t trust the commercial nowadays. Am pleased I got this though since it has actually restored my faith in great manufacturing. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this new Carrier I got considering that I purchased it 7 months ago. Itâ $ s just best.<p>
<p>I am very amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company many years back and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
