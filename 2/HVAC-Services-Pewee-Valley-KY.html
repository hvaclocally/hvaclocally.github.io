<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not provide them.  Second of all like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the unit has been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
