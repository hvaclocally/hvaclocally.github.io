<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
