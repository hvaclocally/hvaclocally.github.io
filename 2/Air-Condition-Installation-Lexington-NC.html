<p>Asthmatic children are especially at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of symptoms in numerous countless asthmatic kids, and may trigger thousands of nonasth-matic children to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke causes nose, throat, and eye inflammation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually connected exposure to secondhand smoke with the onset of chest discomfort.

<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can pay for, a lot of Seattleites need to find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC systems are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle might be the last city in the country to face the reality of a harsh, cruel summer season.<p>
<p>Moist and humid conditions reproduce mold and mildew that can trigger respiratory concerns like allergies and asthma. Depending upon your place, the hot summer season can cause especially humid conditions. Decrease the amount of moisture in the air and suppress the development of annoying molds with a couple of well-placed dehumidifiers. There are a range of humidifier alternatives that will help preserve consistent humidity levels and develop comfortable living conditions in your home.<p>
