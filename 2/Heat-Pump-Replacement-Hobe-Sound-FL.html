<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been burnt out from use.

If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>
