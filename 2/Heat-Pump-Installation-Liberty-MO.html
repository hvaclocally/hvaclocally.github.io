<p>I normally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
