<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a big central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps run on electrical power and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like a space heater) with the same amount of electricity. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Summit Mississippi</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, but to have two significant parts fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
