<h3>HVAC Cleaning in Climax GA</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they identified the issue and repaired very quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
