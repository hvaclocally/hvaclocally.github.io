There are lots of ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead goes into the body. Before it was understood how hazardous lead could be, it was used in paint, fuel, water pipes, and lots of other items.<p>
