The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER rating of a system is the cooling output at varying temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the very same period. Generally, SEER provides more data based on how the EER carries out in different temperatures. The greater the system's SEER ranking, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all home appliances.<p>
