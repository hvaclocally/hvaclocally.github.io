<p>In houses, the most considerable sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pressed wood items made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products made for indoor use include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiberboard includes a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood product and is normally acknowledged as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood item.<p>
<p>Indoor air contamination originates from a range of sources; the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually determined building materials, furnishings, and mold as severe concerns, however much of the risk also originates from burning things.

<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might see unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.
