<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems in houses. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in adequate outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the house. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is dedicated to offering a workplace that is without acknowledged dangers and to investigation problems that might be associated with poor indoor air quality (IAQ). Though particular guidelines have not been established for IAQ in the work place, the Environment, Health and Safety Department (EHS) thinks about recommendations from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).<p>

<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Expert HVAC technicians recommend residents of the City of Redmond have access to cooling and heating unit inside their homes.
