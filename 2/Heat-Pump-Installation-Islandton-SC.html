<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor sensibly, much of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the same).

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, a lot of frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which might go into neighboring ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical centers and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
