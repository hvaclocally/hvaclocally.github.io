Outside CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of co2 in most structures.

<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was extremely thorough and on-time in describing what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn provided excellent client service at the end of the appointment by discussing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance tasks we might want to have actually performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale methods employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung out fixing the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
