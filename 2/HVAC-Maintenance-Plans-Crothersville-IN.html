<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, much of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Chemical pollutants: Volatile natural compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are many, differed, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally happening chemical compounds.

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may choose to change the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit. Speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor system if you do so. However, considering current changes in refrigerants and a/c styles, it might be smarter to change the whole system.<p>
