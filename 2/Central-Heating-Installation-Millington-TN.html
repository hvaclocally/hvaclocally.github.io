<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
