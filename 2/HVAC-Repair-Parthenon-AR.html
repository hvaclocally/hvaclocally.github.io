<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Parthenon AR</h3>
<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and cooling (HVAC) systems are as various as the various homes they serve (single family homes, duplexes, mobile houses, homes, high-rise condos, row real estate, etc.). No matter what the type of house HVAC system, sufficient air flow (ventilation), correct filtration, and humidity control all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will guarantee that it is running securely and not contributing to or causing an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Because an air conditioning system moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both must be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
