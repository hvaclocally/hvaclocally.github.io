<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
