The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really useful in gathering information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to temporarily manage the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and used clear interaction about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
