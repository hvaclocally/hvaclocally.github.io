<h3>Central Air Conditioning Service in Awendaw SC</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
