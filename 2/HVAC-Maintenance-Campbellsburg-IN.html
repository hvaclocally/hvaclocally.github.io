<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
