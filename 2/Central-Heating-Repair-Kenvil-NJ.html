<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
