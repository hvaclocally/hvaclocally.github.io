<h3>Central Air Conditioning Companies in Cayuga NY</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
