<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

Additionally, certain fuels and equipment may require special licenses, and there is minimal flexibility in case of changed heating requirements.

<p>Inquire about training and certifications. A good location to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's type of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it!
