<p>Unstable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a brand-new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, typically referred to as central air" or split-system cooling", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floorings, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c unit to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
