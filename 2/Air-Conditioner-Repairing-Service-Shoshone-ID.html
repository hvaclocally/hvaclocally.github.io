<p>Lead has long been recognized as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " top ecological hazard to the health of kids in the United States." There are lots of ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, weakening paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Prior to it was understood how harmful lead could be, it was utilized in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 should be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>

<p>Over the past couple of years, there has been some publicity recommending that houseplants have actually been shown to lower levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments.
