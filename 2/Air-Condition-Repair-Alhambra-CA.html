<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
