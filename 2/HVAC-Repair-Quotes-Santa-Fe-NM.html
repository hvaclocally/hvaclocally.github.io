<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
