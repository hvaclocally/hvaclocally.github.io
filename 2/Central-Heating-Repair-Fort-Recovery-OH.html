<h3>Significance Of HVAC And Its Role in Fort Recovery OH</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in house construction is to decrease air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, walls, and floors. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor impurities and helps tire them from the house.<p>
