A furnace that is too little, on the other hand, will not have the ability to offer sufficient heat to keep your home comfortable.<p>
<p>Some health effects may show up soon after a single exposure or repeated exposures to a toxin. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate results are treatable and typically short-term. In some cases the treatment is just eliminating the person's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Not long after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants, symptoms of some diseases such as asthma may show up, be intensified or aggravated.<p>
