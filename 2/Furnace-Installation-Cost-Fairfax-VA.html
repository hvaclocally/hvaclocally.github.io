The standards do not require you to alter your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services ought to still be offered for your house's systems. The "life-span" of a central air conditioning conditioner is about 15 to twenty years.

<p>The very first air conditioners and fridges utilized poisonous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
