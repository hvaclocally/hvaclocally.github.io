<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, occasionally linked to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the technique is described as radiant heating.<p>

<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden floor joist system, beneath the wooded subsurface and last flooring finish. This is normally used in a 2nd or third-floor  location and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete pour.
