Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention.
