<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. When going shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit conveniently into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand.

<p>Unpredictable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from procedures or products; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
