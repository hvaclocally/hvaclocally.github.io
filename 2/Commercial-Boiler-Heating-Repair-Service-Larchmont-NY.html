<p>Professional heating unit setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually fail. HVAC professionals advise following this standard guideline when choosing whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the price of a new system, it's finest to purchase brand-new.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works however your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
