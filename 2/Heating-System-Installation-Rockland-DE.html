<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the very same. Once the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly harden and treat-- usually two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
