Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a referral in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
