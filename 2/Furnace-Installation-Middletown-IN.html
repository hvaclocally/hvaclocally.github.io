<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a service was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't completion objective.
