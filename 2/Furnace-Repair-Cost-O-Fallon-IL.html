<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent informing me about our system, and left having fixed the issue with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part. He got along, straightforward and a completely enjoyable individual to have around that entire time. His time and knowledge to SOLVE the issue cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a somewhat unpredictable diagnostic.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet contains the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator. In many split-system air conditioning system, this indoor cabinet also contains a furnace or the indoor part of a heat pump. The a/c's evaporator coil is installed in the cabinet or primary supply duct of this furnace or heatpump. A split-system is the most cost-effective central air conditioner to install if your home already has no air but a furnace conditioner.<p>

<p>If your furnace has actually simply died in sub-zero temperatures or your air conditioning system has actually gone kaput on a blistering day, you'll probably be glad to hire the very first repairman who comes to your house that day. But, if you're planning a expensive or major upgrade to your home's heating, cooling or duct, it deserves the time to research and interview several companies before employing one.<p>

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough job that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps men working. When a sales guy pertains to your home he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and should not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the choices for your requirements and you decide if you need it.<p>
