<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for many years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs suddenly appear greater than regular, it is most likely time to consider a brand-new system. New heating equipment is much more effective-- you'll see lower fuel costs right now, not to discuss the cash you'll minimize repair costs. If your heating system is 25 years old or more, you can most likely expect to cut your fuel costs in half.<p>

<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Cascade CO</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
