By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can normally be carried out in just a couple of minutes, often without any tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
