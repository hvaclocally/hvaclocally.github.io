Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut down completely.<p>

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years ago and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
