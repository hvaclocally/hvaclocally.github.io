<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
