The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other short articles with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and people. It does not count on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the whole surface area of a flooring warms the lower half of the space, enveloping residents in warmth at a lower overall temperature-- sometimes up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a standard heater."
