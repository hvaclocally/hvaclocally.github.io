<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace specialists typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners are more effective than space ac system. In addition, they are out of the way, quiet, and hassle-free to run. To conserve energy and cash, you must try to buy an energy-efficient air conditioning unit and decrease your central air conditioning conditioner's energy use. In an average air-conditioned house, air conditioning takes in more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy annually, triggering power plants to release about 3,500 pounds of co2 and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>

<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a hazardous environmental pollutant.

Before it was understood how hazardous lead could be, it was used in paint, fuel, pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
