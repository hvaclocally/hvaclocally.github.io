<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known reality that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is simply as essential as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will often develop in ductwork, restricting airflow. Because ductwork is so complicated, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can seem very complicated in the beginning, needing specialized tools, equipment, and know-how. When you choose Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't need to stress over a thing.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
