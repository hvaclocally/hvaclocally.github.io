<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, instead of outside or industrial settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price great however Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, but it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have an unfavorable impact on occupants-- outdoors air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
