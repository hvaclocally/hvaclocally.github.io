<p>Structures are designed or intended to respond actively to some of these changes around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sterilize, and preserve surfaces to improve their efficiency, look, or durability. In other cases, such changes discreetly or even considerably alter buildings in ways that might be important to their own integrity or their influence on structure occupants through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We might find it helpful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, specifically, a few of the approaches used by scientists studying communities, in order to gain a boosted understanding of the environments in which we spend the majority of our time, our buildings.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
