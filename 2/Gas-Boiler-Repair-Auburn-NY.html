Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that safeguard your a/c system from flooding. One of the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great possibility; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on uncommon events.<p>
