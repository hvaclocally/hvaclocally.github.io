<h3>HVAC Company in Thornwood NY</h3>
<p>We called Elite HVACS on one of the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to assess situation & chose to opt for them for the work. I am happy to state that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but also changed the heating unit which was old. Everyone we talked to from beginning to end were extremely professional, polite and the work was really effectively done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Dirty Filters: â $ " Â Filters obstructed with dust, animal hair and other particles lead to issues like failure to supply adequate heat, excess sound and the furnace running all the time. If you discover the issue and have a washable filter, thereâ $ s no charge. DIY filter replacement choices range from $3 to $40, and you get what you pay for. If the technician comes to your home, that may be an extremely pricey dirty-filter diagnosis.
