<h3>Heating Systems in Pacifica CA</h3>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
