<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might observe unpleasant or moldy odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse, talk with your physician about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
