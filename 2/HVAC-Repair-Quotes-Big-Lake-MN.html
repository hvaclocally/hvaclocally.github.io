<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
