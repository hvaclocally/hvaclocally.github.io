<p>There's a big difference in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common kind of home heating-- convection. Over the previous century, the majority of houses in cooler environments were warmed by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the procedure of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the floors, ceilings and walls warmed. In turn, the objects in the room, like furnishings and individuals, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have built-in delay functions. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
