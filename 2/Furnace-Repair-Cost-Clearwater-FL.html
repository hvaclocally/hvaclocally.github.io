<h3>HVAC Filters in Clearwater FL</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

In some cases there is a musty odor however mold can not be seen.

Possibilities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found.
