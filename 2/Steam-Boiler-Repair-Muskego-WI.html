<p>Your Evaluation This is my 3rd time using Around the Clock. Ilan always makes himself available - whether it's a heating problem in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is proficient with these devices).

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
