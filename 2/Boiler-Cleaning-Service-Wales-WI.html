<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Wales WI?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system. We picked getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON.

You ought to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
