<p>I typically do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Through normal usage and the unit's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning system might end up being extremely filthy. These elements of the devices are crucial for efficient air conditioning. The technician cleans up all components, and checks connections to guarantee they are secure. The unit is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic components are examineded for correct function and total condition. This is an outstanding opportunity to determine parts that are used or defective. Replacing them to repair the cooling may be a lot cheaper when the problem is fairly minor.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose spent time repairing the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
