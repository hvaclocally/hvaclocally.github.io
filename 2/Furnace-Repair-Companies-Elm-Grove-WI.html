<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may go into close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor fountains in public attractions.
