<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like prolonged automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
