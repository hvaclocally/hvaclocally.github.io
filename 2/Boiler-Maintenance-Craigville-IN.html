<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
