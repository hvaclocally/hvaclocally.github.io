<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my businesses, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern. He is truthful, trustworthy, and sensible on cost. It's tough to find a sincere AC person and I'm happy I found Luis. Extremely suggest Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: They were excellent! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially asked for. They fulfilled my requirements completely by supplying an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing additional products. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also promptly followed up with the needed assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>This evaluation is for changing a 17 years of age AC with a new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who discussed our alternatives did an outstanding job in making sure we understood the pros and cons of each option. The service technicians who installed the brand-new system were expert and quick, while taking some time to make sure we understood how the brand-new system worked. In general a first rate experience.<p>
