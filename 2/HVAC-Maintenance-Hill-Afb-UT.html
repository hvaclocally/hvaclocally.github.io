<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Hill Afb Utah</h3>
<p>If no pollutant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Extreme re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the number of employees in the area, stale air may also be a problem.<p>
<p>The heat pump acquired popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heat pumps can extract heat from different sources, such as environmental air, exhaust air from a structure, or from the ground. Heat pumps move heat from outside the structure into the air inside. At first, heat pump HVAC systems were just utilized in moderate climates, however with improvements in low temperature level operation and decreased loads due to more efficient homes, they are increasing in popularity in cooler environments.<p>
<p>Outdoor pollutants. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and irritants discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Experts suggest utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and usually are better suited for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
