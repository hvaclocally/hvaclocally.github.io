OSHA, NIOSH and others have set NO2 standards, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has set standards for both-- consisting of for indoor air.<p>
<p>For example, contaminants may gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing toxins into the environment. Or if the outside air consumption is located near a source of moisture or other outside pollutant, it might function as a path to bring the contaminants inside. Or the ventilation system might not be working along with it needs to-- if debris is obstructing the outdoor air intake, for instance, or the filters are contaminated or inadequately preserved.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Combats the hot days: Though most temperature levels in Seattle are acceptably average, you can expect a minimum of one month during which temperatures will reach above 80 degrees. There were 45 days above 80 in 2015! Just a few years earlier, Seattle saw a record temperature level of 103 degrees, and there have actually been lots of long, dry, hot streaks ever since. When the heat gets intolerable, a central air conditioning system in your house means you have the power to change the temperature level to a consistent temperature.<p>
