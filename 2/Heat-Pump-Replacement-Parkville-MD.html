<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>

Individuals also react very in a different way to direct exposure to indoor air contaminants.

For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature deterioration, causing holes and cracks. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the part.  a very helpful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
