<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each space.

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
