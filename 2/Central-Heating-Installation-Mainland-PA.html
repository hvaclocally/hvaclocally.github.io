<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not use them.. Secondly like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to appropriately service and the unit has been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
