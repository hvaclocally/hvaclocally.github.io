<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to keep an eye out for is the dust that gathers during summertimes. The very best thing to do is ensuring that the heating unit burners are checked and cleaned up completely prior to colder seasons start. Constantly be sure that the furnace is tidied up yearly to prevent soot and condensation which causes burners to stop working effectively. If your furnace is in a very poor condition, maybe it is time to start thinking about buying a new one.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>How To Eradicate Boiler Issues in Geneva GA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
