The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their total power must not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system.

Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the spaces might not have a really comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not simple, given that it considers not just the small power of the systems, however likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

Extremely delighted with their service. Would advise them anytime.<p>
