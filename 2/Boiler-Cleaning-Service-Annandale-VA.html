<h3>Heating And Cooling Repair in Annandale Virginia</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, but to have 2 significant components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair at Annandale VA</h3>
<p>The icing issue ends up being much more serious with lower outside temperatures, so heatpump are frequently installed in tandem with a more standard kind of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used rather of the heat pump during harsher winter season temperature levels. In this case, the heatpump is utilized efficiently during the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
