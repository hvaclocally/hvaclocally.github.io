During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are ending up being typical features of environment-friendly houses as part of the growing green structure movement.
