<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs.

Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to 2 days might end up being a source for mold development and need to be discarded. In some cases there is a moldy odor however mold can not be seen.

In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products consisting of carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the moisture problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely tidy the area using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
