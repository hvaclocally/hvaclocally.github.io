<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan.

The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair.
