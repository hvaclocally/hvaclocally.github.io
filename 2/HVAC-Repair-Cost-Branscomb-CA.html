<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Branscomb CA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely delighted that someone as skilled as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c unit before you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to check AC units even in winter. We want we had known him then.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. Nevertheless, you'll conserve money over the long term because of the lower energy costs. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as conventional air-source systems. The absence of moving parts implies you're less likely to invest big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're significantly more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source units.<p>
