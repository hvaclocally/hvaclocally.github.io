<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The very first a/c unit and fridges employed flammable or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
