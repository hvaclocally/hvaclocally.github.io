<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
