Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also.

Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are available if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank.
