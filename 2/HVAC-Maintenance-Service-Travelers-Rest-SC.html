Viruses, bacteria, and bacteria also can live in the air you breathe every day. These airborne contaminants can impact your home convenience equipment, too. Enabled to flow through your house and your system, these and other particles can develop on the indoor coil, preventing air flow and lowering heating and cooling efficiency.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
