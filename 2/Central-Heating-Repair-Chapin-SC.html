<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
