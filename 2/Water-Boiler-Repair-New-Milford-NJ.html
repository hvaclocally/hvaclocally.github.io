It does not depend on heating or moving air to transfer warmth.<p>

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, since it is secured inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
