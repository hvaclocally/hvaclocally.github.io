<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
