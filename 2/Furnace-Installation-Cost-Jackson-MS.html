<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and therefore, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat allergen could cause an asthma attack in people with feline allergic reactions, however not in those individuals who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>Because immunity differs significantly from individual to individual, it is not useful to design a universal guideline fit for all in terms of direct exposure and health. EDLab at Pure Air Control Services performed a 10 year research study analyzing more than 7,000 structures and over 25,000 environmental samples that were collected throughout the United States and abroad. The structure type consisted of both residential and commercial. The majority of samples evaluated were evaluated favorable for fungi and germs.<p>
