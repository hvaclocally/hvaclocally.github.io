<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is normally greater than numerous heatpump options, they can still be extremely effective, depending upon the design you purchase.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might enter close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and retirement home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outdoor fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
