<p>The probability of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends upon several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two crucial influences. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a pollutant depends upon specific sensitivity, which differs greatly from individual to individual. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical toxins too.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur in time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to work until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
