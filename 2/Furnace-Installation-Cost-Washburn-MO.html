<p>Heat pumps are a dream become a reality for folks in Seattle. Cooling is something that the majority of Seattleites will just use sparingly, however due to the fact that heat pumps can supply both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the very best of both worlds!

If a heat pump remains in your future, the best time to install a/c in your house may very well be when your heater breaks down.<p>
<p>If your single phase air conditioning system isn't old adequate to validate replacement, think about a whole home dehumidifier. By setting up dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can take pleasure in some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without changing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, improving indoor air quality and allowing greater convenience at higher temperatures.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
