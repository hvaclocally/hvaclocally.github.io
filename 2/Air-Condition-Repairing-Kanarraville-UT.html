<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can afford, many Seattleites should find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor display screens.
