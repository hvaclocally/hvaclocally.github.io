<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
