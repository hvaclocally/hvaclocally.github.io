<h3>Ways To Get the Most From Your HVAC System in Pebble Beach CA</h3>
<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you employ to install your central air unit. In fact, you can even DIY, despite our strong recommendation not to do so. If you do take our recommendation, anticipate to pay between $300 and $1,000 in labor expenses to set up central air. Moreover, cooling contractors may charge an additional $50 to $200 for extra materials and equipment.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
