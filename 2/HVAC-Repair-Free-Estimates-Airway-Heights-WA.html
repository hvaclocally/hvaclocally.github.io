<h3>What You Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair at Airway Heights WA</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various home performance upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us debate which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's product and services was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to perform the needed electrical improvements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Oil furnaces are generally not really efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however many do not accomplish an effectiveness higher than 90%.
