<p>I was extremely delighted in the start since things ran efficiently without any sound. Furthermore, I saw visible modifications in my electricity bills. After two years, things began to alter. There have actually been awkward noises. I got it inspected and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. In general, it has been a good experience. Dependable on the whole. Cool operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its looks in the beginning. But then recognized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>When mounting a wall sensor, consider the height at which they must be put.

For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the highest concentrations inside buildings are usually near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is much heavier than air and remains near the flooring.<p>
