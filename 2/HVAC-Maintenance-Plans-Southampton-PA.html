<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
