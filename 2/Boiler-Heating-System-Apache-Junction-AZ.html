You do not conduct repairs by yourself pipes system, or replace your own electrical grid. The reasons that you do not do those things are obvious. You do not have the tools, or the expertise, to be sure that you carry out those treatments securely and properly. Specialists, however, do have the tools and know-how to do the job appropriately.
