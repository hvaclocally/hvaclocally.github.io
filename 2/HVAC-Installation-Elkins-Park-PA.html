<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house via ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a fairly straightforward procedure. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>
