<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, frequently described as central air" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floorings, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
