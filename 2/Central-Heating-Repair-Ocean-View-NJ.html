<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
