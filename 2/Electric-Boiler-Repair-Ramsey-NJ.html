<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
