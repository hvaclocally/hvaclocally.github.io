This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>A regular furnace tune up can maximize performance and provide longer long lasting home heating. However, there are times when a simple maintenance call can recognize a concern that will require a significant financial investment to correct. Then, it's choice time.
