If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the appropriate temperature level. Heaters that kick on regularly may be due to a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly.
