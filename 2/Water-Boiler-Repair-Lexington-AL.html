<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
