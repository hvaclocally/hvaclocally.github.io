They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of allowing heat to heat up the concrete piece listed below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
