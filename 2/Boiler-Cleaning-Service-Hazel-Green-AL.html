<p>Next, and maybe just as crucial when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to appropriately cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been checked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside ought to be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
