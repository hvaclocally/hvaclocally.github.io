<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
