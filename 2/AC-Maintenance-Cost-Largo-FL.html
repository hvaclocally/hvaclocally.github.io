The primary external system can be connected to several various indoor types: floor, ceiling, cassette, and so on<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
