<p>All heater have some level of air filtration. From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some standard maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne toxins flowing through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from building up on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your home that perfect temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those typical air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to costly repairs down the roadway. So, make certain to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service plan which generally consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may go into nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and retirement home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
