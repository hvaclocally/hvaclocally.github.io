If numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it.
