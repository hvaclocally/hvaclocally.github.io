<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, see Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
