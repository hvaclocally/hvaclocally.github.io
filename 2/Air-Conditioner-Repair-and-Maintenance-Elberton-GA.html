These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
