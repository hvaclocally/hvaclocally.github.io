<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

Over the past century, the majority of homes in colder environments were warmed by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the ceilings, walls and floorings warmed. In turn, the items in the room, like furniture and individuals, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
