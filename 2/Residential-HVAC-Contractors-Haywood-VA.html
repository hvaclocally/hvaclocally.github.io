<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Haywood VA</h3>

(If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
