<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
