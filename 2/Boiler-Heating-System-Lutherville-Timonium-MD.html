<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit pollutants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>

At lower levels of exposure, CO triggers mild results that are typically mistaken for the influenza. These signs include headaches, dizziness, nausea, tiredness and disorientation. The impacts of CO exposure can differ significantly from person to individual depending upon age, total health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
