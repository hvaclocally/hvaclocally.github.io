The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon numerous factors consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions.

Some people can end up being sensitized to chemical or biological pollutants after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
