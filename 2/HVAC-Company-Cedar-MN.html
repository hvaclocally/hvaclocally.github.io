<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>

In late winter and early spring, it might still be too cold to toss open the windows to pull out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it's important to be aware of some of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that may be hiding in your surroundings.<p>
