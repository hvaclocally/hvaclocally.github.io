<h3>Commercial Air Conditioner in Mc Kittrick CA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years ago and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
