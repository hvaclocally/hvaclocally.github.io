If the exhaust outlets are obstructed, they can cause an unsafe build-up and jeopardize your safety.

<p>These guys have been great. At a realtor, I sometimes require contractors to offer me an opinion for what work on a house might cost. Recently I needed to get in touch with these men two times. They came out rapidly and gave me a no nonsense estimate for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely wouldn't wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty. Stability isn't just their name, it's a business model they take seriously. You men are officially on speed dial. Speak to you soon.<p>

<p>The primary health effect connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
