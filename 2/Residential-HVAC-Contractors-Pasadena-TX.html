<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are used to seeing this enter the backyards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the components are housed in a metal box outside of the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal components also. Split systems are perfect for cooling several spaces simultaneously, but are not extremely energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution.

There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this.
