<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
