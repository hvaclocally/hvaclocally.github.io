<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is often important to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such details can sometimes be acquired by requesting copies of air tracking data from the employer. If keeping track of data is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent must request that the company have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this data might identify possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when pollutant concentrations are very low, keeping track of information may not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
