While geothermal systems do utilize some electricity, they launch far fewer greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating systems that need natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are prone to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot beside the radiators.
