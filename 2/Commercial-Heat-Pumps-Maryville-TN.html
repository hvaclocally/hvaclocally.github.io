<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
