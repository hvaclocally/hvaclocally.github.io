<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, see Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
