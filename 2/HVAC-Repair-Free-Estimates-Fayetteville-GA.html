The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power needs to not go beyond the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, given that the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor system. Simply put, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the estimation of the overall power is not basic, since it takes into account not just the nominal power of the systems, however likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
