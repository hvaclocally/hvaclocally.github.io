The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power needs to not go beyond the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, given that the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor system.
