<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future.

<p>Some sources, such as building products, furnishings, and family products like air fresheners, release pollutants more or less constantly. Other sources, related to activities performed in the home, release toxins intermittently. These consist of cigarette smoking, making use of unvented or malfunction-ing stoves, heaters, or space heaters, making use of solvents in cleaning and hobby activities, making use of paint strippers in refurnishing activities, and the use of cleaning items and pesticides in housekeeping. High toxin concentrations can stay in the air for extended periods after a few of these activities.<p>
