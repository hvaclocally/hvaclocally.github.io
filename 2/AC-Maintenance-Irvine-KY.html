<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
