<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Marion IN</h3>
<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has watched the single-family house installation business completely turn on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with newbies more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
