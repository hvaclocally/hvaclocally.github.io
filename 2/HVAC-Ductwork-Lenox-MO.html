<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.  Second of all like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the system has been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
