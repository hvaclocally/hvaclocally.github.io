We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to check the air conditioning system prior to you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to test AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
