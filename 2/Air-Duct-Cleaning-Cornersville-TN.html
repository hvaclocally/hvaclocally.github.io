<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in efficiency benefit because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions since they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Since a system is set up in each space or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>

I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
