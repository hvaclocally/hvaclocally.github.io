In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
