<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
