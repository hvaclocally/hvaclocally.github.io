Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating unit, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
