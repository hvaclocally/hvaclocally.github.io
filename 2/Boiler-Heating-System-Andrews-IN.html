The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
