<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold might be living in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and a/c system. There are several design methods in use today; nevertheless, all ground source heat pumps operate with similar concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
