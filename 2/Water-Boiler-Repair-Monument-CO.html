<p>Ensure there are no rugs, furniture, or anything else restricting the flow of air. Not just will obstructed vents and registers impact your convenience, they can also result in duct leaks due to excessive air pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused spaces is NOT a great concept. You won't save any money and will wind up causing more problems for your heating unit.<p>
<p>We look at ideas before we offer recommendations to replace instead of repair a heating unit. Among the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher every year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It might be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>Typically the most reliable way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions.

Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later in this section.<p>
<p>The predominant health impact associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon.

EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
