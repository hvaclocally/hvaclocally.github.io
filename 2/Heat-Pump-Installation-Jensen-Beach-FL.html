<p>Central air conditioners, frequently referred to as central air" or split-system cooling", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floors covered by grills) carry cooled air from the ac system to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
