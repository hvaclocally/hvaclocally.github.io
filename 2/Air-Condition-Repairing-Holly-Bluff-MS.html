<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All items in the hot zone reach stability in temperature level after the radiant heat system has been operating for a while, consisting of people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>

<p>A radiator is the part of your vehicle that keeps the engine cool and secures it from extreme heating. To be cool, the radiator needs to stay tidy - constantly.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
