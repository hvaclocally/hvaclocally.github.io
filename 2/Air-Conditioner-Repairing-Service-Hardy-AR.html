<p>Check these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed.

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
