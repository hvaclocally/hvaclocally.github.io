<p>Proper ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same pollutants. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners are more effective than room air conditioning system. In addition, they are out of the way, quiet, and convenient to operate. To conserve energy and money, you need to try to buy an energy-efficient air conditioning system and minimize your central air conditioning conditioner's energy usage. In a typical air-conditioned home, a/c takes in more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical power each year, triggering power plants to produce about 3,500 pounds of co2 and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>

<p>Outdoor contaminants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home.
