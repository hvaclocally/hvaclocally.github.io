<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working, stability Energy was fast to react. They showed up the next day and changed two heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new heating systems can heat the house. Honestly, our home heater is made complex, Rob and his group repaired the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
