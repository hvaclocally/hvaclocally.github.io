<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up.
