<p>Before you go out and purchase an a/c, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be setting up the ac system?

<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
