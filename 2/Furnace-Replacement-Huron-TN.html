<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a big merchant who asked not to be named due to the fact that he did not have permission to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a team that routinely monitors energy usage and temperature levels in stores to save money on costs (particularly during the night) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the shops fluctuate outside of an acceptable variety that might prevent customers from shopping at the shop.<p>

<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least as soon as a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that frequently, our nationally representative study found. Approximately 40 percent rarely or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
