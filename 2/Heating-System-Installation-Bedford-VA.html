<p>Lots of AC systems come with a number of special features that can further improve efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, house owners might want to try to find one that includes an integrated filter light that will signal you when the air filter needs to be altered. Another popular feature to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on at night to minimize energy expenses even more. Obviously, more functions mean greater central air conditioning costs.<p>
<p>In some cases a momentary indoor air quality issue is created just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complex issues-- identified by regularly unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will require a different tack. Depending upon the issue you're experiencing, among the three tactics below might be suitable.<p>
