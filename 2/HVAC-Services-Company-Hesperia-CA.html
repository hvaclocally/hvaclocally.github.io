<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on different house performance upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.)

This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
