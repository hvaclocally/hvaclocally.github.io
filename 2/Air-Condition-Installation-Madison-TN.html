<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
