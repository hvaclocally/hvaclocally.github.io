Approximately 40 percent hardly ever or never clean their humidifier or kitchen variety hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have never cleaned up or changed their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
