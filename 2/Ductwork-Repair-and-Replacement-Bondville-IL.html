According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same contaminants. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
