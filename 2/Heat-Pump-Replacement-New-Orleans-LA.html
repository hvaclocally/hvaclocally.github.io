<h3>Finding Greatest HVAC Contractors in New Orleans LA</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in home building and construction is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, roofings, and floorings. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air helps and waters down indoor pollutants tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
