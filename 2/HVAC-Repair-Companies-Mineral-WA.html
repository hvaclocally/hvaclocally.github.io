<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
