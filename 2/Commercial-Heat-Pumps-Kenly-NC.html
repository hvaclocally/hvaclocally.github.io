<h3>Electric Furnace in Kenly NC</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is sincere, trustworthy, and reasonable on cost. It's tough to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you must look out for. First, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
