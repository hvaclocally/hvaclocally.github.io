<p>My eldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think about anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
