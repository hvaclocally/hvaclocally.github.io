<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem.

A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step.

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years ago and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
