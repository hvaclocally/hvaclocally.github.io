Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
