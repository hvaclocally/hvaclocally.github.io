<p>Self-installation tends to produce more problems than it fixes.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>A specialized a/c unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard ac system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the exact same air path. Since its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, because all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is really heated up, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
