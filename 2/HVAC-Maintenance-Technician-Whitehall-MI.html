While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, because some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
