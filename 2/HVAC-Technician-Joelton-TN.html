<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to provide adequate changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
