<p>The compressor can overheat and shut down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them again. Shut off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work properly after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC will not work totally unless you do this.<p>
