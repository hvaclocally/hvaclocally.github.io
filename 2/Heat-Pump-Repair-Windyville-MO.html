<p>If no impurity sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. Stale air may also be a problem when ventilation is not enough to represent a boost in the number of employees in the location.<p>
<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Allergen and mold love wetness. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% helps keep them and other allergens under control. A dehumidifier (and air conditioning system throughout summer months) helps in reducing wetness in indoor air and effectively manages irritants, Lang says. An air conditioner likewise minimizes indoor pollen count - another plus for allergic reaction -sufferers.<p>
<p>It is not suggested that "routine" occupational direct exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to identify if the general indoor air quality fulfills a particular requirement. Occupational direct exposure limitations noted in health and wellness regulations and the Threshold Limitation Values ® (TLVs) suggested by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are meant as a guide to avoid illness or certain impacts (like eye and nose irritation) in commercial scenarios.
