<h3>Heating System Installation in Rehoboth Massachusetts</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>

<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company utilized 98% of the existing material acquired with your house. This company presented a service arrangement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the inspection on a really cold day they killed the furnace claiming health hazard reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a brand-new resident I have learned how to recognize the truthful HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
