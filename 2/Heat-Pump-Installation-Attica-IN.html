<p>Current Evaluation: They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my requirements entirely by offering an expert quote with choices, without pushing additional items. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The also quickly followed up with the necessary evaluations from the city.

<p>The primary health impact associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
