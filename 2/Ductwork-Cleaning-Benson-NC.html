<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works however your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Benson NC</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in house building and construction is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, floorings, and roofs. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>The primary step to fixing any problem is identifying what the issue is in the top place. If we find your system requires a major repair, we waive our diagnostic costs. When we do any repair, the parts we utilize are supported with a two-year parts service warranty. If you have actually spoken with another company and got a quote, our diagnostics service and waived cost offer you with a 2nd alternative that comes with the guarantee perk.<p>
