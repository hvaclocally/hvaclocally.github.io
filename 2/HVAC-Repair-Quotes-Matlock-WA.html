<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
