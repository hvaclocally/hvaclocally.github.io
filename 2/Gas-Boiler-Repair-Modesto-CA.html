<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most budget-friendly. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your home that ideal temperature throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those common air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to costly repairs down the road. So, make sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service plan which typically consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is dirty, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be operating at optimal efficiency and could overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, creating a cycle that doesn't end. An overworked system will likewise trigger your energy costs to increase. It's possible that the size of AC unit you have is not huge enough for your home. If the system is too little, it will need to work harder and might get too hot. Generally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>
