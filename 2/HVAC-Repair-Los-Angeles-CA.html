They are also safe compared to older-style electric baseboard heating systems. They are available in several types: wall-mounted systems that are excellent for small areas like restrooms, cove heating systems that are similar to baseboard heaters but are tucked safely up by the ceiling, and ceiling-mounted convected heat panels that supply a mild sunshine-like warmth from above.<p>
