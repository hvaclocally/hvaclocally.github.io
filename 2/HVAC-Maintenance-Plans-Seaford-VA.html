<p>The purpose of most structure ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for resident convenience while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building safety at affordable energy expenses. Load calculating is described as the Handbook J calculation and need to be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or unit cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square footage alone.
