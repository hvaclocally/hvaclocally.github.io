<p>The very first air conditioning unit and refrigerators used flammable or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>A main factor in the avoidance of health symptoms is an efficient, correctly developed and running ventilation system. The ventilation system figures out the quality of the indoor air by controlling the amount of air that is contributed to the office environment, the cleanliness of such outside air, and the rate at which the office air and its contaminants are either tired to the re-circulated or outside throughout the building.<p>
<p>For contaminants besides radon, measurements are most proper when there are either health symptoms or indications of bad ventilation and particular sources or contaminants have been recognized as possible causes of indoor air quality issues. Testing for lots of contaminants can be costly. Prior to monitoring your house for pollutants besides radon, consult your state or local health department or experts who have experience in resolving indoor air quality issues in nonindustrial structures.<p>
<p>EPA's Total Direct exposure Assessment Methodology (GROUP) studies discovered levels of about a dozen typical natural pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside houses than outside, despite whether the houses were located in rural or extremely commercial areas. Extra GROUP research studies show that while individuals are utilizing items consisting of natural chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to extremely high pollutant levels, and elevated concentrations can continue the air long after the activity is finished.<p>
