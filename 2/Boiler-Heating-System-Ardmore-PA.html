<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils.

It likewise avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
