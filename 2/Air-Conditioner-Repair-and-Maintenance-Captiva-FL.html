<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, periodically linked to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the technique is described as radiant heating.<p>
