<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
