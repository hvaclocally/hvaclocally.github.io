We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We chose getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
