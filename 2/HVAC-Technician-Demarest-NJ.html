<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that collects during summer seasons. The very best thing to do is making sure that the heater burners are examined and cleaned up completely before cooler seasons begin. Always be sure that the furnace is cleaned up every year to avoid soot and condensation which triggers burners to stop working properly. Possibly it is time to begin believing about purchasing a brand-new one if your furnace is in a really poor condition.<p>
<p>A SEER score stands for Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER rating of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the same period. Basically, SEER provides more information based upon how the EER performs in different temps. The greater the unit's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all appliances.<p>
