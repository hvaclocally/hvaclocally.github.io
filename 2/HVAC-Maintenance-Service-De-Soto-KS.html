<p>The quality of the air inside our workplaces, schools and houses matters, particularly because we spend the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioning system assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in incredibly damp environments or in cases where the a/c unit is large, it may not accomplish a low humidity.

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as near your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Airborne irritants are merely a truth of life. Molds can trigger flare-ups of allergic reaction signs, and in some cases, trigger asthma attacks. Bacteria, viruses, and germs likewise can live in the air you breathe every day. These airborne pollutants can affect your house convenience equipment, too. Allowed to distribute through your home and your system, these and other particles can develop on the indoor coil, preventing airflow and reducing heating and cooling performance. By using the products and services we provide, you can reduce and frequently remove these unwanted air-borne toxins from your home, leaving clean air and safe surfaces throughout your household.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities. You might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and efficiency if you currently have a house heating system. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to search for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one significant drawback of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or very hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
