<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

Then yank the detach block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2). If the a/c service still doesn't work correctly after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC will not work fully unless you do this.<p>
