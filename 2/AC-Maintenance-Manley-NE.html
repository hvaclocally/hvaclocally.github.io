<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

Keeping what is probably the most expensive and important system in your house (cooling and heating) correctly maintained will help keep your biggest investment of your life in great shape.<p>
<p>Some health results may show up quickly after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures to a contaminant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate results are usually short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is just removing the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Not long after exposure to some indoor air toxins, signs of some diseases such as asthma might show up, be intensified or intensified.<p>
<p>What happens when you have an emergency? The very first reaction of many people is to panic.
