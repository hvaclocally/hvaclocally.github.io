<p>Air pollutants can vary from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your pets to harmful gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air toxin arising from natural gas that gets away into your home without being burned off. Older houses may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In bathrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where moisture levels are generally greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
