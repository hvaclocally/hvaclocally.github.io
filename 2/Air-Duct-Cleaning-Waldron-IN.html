<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>A regular furnace tune up can take full advantage of performance and provide longer lasting home heating. Nevertheless, there are times when a basic maintenance call can determine a problem that will require a considerable investment to fix. Then, it's decision time.

The choice to replace or repair depends on you, and typically it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, taking into consideration the age of the equipment, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely offers higher energy effectiveness and comes with service warranty protection.<p>
