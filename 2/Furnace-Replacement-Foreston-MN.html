However, pick your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same).

<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, however it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level.

To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have an unfavorable impact on occupants-- outside air should be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
