<h3>Central Heating Installation in Chappaqua New York</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Energy performance can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by several thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is really critical to keeping a correct temperature level.<p>
