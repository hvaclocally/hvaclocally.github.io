<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

A basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, because all components of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat is removed.
