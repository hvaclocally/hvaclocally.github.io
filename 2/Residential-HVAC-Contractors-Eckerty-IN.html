If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>A geothermal heating system is more reliable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar energy. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar energy depends on regular sunshine to work efficiently. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the sun nor the wind, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and reputable  source of energy.<p>
