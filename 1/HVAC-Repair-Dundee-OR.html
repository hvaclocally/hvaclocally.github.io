<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold.

Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
