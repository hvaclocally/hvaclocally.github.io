<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, many of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.
