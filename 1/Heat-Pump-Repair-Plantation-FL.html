<h3>Electric Heating in Plantation FL</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
