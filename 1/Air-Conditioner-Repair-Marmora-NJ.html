<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, however it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads.
