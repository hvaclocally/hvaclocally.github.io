<h3>AC Duct Replacement in Gadsden TN</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they identified the concern and fixed really quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce contaminants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
