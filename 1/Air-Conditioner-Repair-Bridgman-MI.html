<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
