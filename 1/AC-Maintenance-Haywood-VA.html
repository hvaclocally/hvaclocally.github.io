<h3>Heat And Air Units Repair in Haywood Virginia</h3>
<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is wintry, the evaporator coil is most likely frozen. Also, if the air conditioning system smells bad, there could be bacteria buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat far from your house. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to replace the air conditioner's evaporator coil.<p>

<p>Since they eliminate moisture from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a typically plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate issues, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
