<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. If items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
