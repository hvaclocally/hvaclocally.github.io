<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more difficulties, given that some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each space. However, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor unit rather of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your ac system and heat pump need to be without all obstructions and debris. Obstructions can obstruct the circulation of condensed water and trigger moisture accumulation within the system. Excess moisture can trigger problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the property, uneven temperature level guideline, bacteria, and compromised air quality. An expert maintenance technician will clean the condensate and flush drain to ensure all excess moisture flows far from the system.<p>
