<h3>Common Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Bexar AR</h3>
<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are as various as the various houses they serve (single family houses, duplexes, mobile houses, apartment or condos, high-rise condos, row real estate, and so on). No matter what the type of home HVAC system, adequate air circulation (ventilation), proper purification, and humidity manage all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will make sure that it is running safely and not contributing to or causing an indoor air issue.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
