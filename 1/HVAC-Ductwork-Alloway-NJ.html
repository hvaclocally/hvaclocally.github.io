<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace specialists frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
