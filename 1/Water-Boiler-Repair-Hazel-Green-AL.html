<p>PE companies tend to run with the goal of selling or spinning off a company at some point. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a big service in the field, and even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management.

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
