<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
