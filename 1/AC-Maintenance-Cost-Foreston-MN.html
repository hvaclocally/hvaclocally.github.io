<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The main factor property owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the amount of services provided. If the system is new and still under a maker's guarantee, the cost may not be worthwhile. Any significant repairs must be covered under the manufacturer's service warranty. Nevertheless, some producers require regular maintenance as a term of the service warranty.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home occupants. Unlike other types of a/c, evaporative coolers count on the outdoors air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the inside of a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to press the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to understand and keep.<p>
