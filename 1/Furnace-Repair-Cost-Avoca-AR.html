<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation costs. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other factors that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also exacerbate indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system might be infected (since of mold in duct lining or germs on coil or filters, for example), and the system may spread out these contaminants throughout the home. Second, the HVAC duct circulation system can spread toxins from one portion of the home to another. Routine maintenance and duct sealing can assist decrease these issues.<p>
