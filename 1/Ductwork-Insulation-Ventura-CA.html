<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your ac system is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. If it leakages, merely including refrigerant is not an option. A skilled technician ought to repair any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the efficiency and effectiveness of your ac system is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the manufacturer's requirements, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can likewise be damaging to the environment.<p>

He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
