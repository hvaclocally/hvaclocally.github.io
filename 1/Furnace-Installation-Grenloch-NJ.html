<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my companies, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He assisted me problem shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again.
