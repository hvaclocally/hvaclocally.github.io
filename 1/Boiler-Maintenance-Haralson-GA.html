The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
