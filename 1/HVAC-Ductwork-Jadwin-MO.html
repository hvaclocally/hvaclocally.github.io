<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ may discover musty or unpleasant odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
