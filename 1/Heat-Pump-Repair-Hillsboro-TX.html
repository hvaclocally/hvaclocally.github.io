Wetness management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the higher temperatures sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to provide thermal convenience inside your home.

<p>A specialized a/c that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard ac system because both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the very same air course. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, since all elements of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is actually heated, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
