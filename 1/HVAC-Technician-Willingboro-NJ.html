<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (revealed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends on keeping it according to the manufacturer's directions.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single go to, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance gos to each year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and normally some other advantages. Some companies use priority appointments to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
