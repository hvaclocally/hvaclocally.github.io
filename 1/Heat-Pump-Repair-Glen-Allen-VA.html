<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very valuable in collecting details on the phone and offering clear directions about how to briefly manage the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
