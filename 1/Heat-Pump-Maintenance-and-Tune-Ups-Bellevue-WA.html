<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service at Bellevue WA</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on various home efficiency upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.)

We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's items and services was excellent. Taylor assisted us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to perform the necessary electrical improvements to save on cost.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
