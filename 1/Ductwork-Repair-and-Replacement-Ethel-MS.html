<h3>Floor Heating System in Ethel MS</h3>
<p>The federal government recommends that houses be weatherized in order to reduce the quantity of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions should also be taken to decrease contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.)

<p>Oil heaters are generally not extremely efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, however most do not achieve a performance higher than 90%. A couple of high-end brand names have an efficiency of 95% by using a condenser. These are more expensive, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Because a drain needs to be installed, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
