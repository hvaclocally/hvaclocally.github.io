<p>Since they eliminate moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a normally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, below.<p>
