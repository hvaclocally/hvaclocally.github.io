<p>Sean was very practical. He is an extremely pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>When all the jobs have actually been completed, the last task is to check the system to make sure it cools effectively. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat. This final check might point out faults in the thermostat, which may be as simple as a requirement to replace batteries. A failure to switch on may simply involve a tripped breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician discusses any issues or concerns and makes recommendations about upgrades where appropriate.<p>
