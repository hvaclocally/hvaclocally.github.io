<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes.

Do not accept them till they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
