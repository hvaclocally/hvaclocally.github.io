<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen gradually since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to work until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
