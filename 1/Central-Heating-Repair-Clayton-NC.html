<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
