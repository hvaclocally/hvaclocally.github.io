<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. However, much of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item.
