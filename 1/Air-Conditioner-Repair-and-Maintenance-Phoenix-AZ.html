On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested informing me about our system, and left having resolved the problem with a basic repair he did on-site, not changing the whole part. He was friendly, simple and a thoroughly pleasurable individual to have around that entire time. His time and proficiency to FIX the concern cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a somewhat unpredictable diagnostic.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years approximately.
