<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil change in your cars and truck. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and particles in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. During high usage months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a reference in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
