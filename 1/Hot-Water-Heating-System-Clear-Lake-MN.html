<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. Squealing noises from a belt-drive air handler generally take place when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. Most of the times, the belt is incorrectly aligned or used and requires replacement. Follow the directions above under A/c unit Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>
