An option to packaged systems is the use of different indoor and outdoor coils in split systems Split systems are preferred and widely utilized around the world other than in The United States and Canada. In North America, split systems are usually seen in residential applications, but they are gaining appeal in little commercial buildings. The split systems are an excellent option for little buildings where ductwork is not feasible or where the area conditioning performance is of prime concern. 19 The benefits of ductless air conditioning systems consist of easy installation, no ductwork, greater zonal control, flexibility of control and peaceful operation. citation needed In area conditioning, the duct losses can account for 30% of energy consumption. 20 Using minisplit can lead to energy cost savings in space conditioning as there are no losses associated with ducting.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators prohibited. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the approach as "that German technology". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to develop a business coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take actions to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-134a, r-404a and r-410a are, since 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and cooling, R-1234yf in cars and trucks, R-32 in residential air conditioning and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.

<p>IAQ can be affected by gases (consisting of carbon monoxide, radon, volatile natural substances ), particulates, microbial contaminants (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stress factor that can cause adverse health conditions.
