<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
