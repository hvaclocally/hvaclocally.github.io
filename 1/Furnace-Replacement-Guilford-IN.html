<p>Immediate results may show up after a single direct exposure or duplicated direct exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate impacts are treatable and typically short-term.

Symptoms of some diseases, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also show up soon after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge pollutants.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
