<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Lake Worth Beach FL</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts years, given that it is protected inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical standards get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
