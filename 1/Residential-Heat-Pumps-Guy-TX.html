We clean, sanitize, and maintain surface areas to boost their efficiency, look, or longevity. In other cases, such changes subtly and even significantly alter buildings in ways that may be necessary to their own stability or their impact on structure residents through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time.

<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ may observe musty or undesirable odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are worsening, speak to your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, often referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floorings, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c unit to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
