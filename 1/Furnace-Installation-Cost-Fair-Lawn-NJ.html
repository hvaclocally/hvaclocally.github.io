<p>Some biological contaminants activate allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma. Infectious illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing toxic substances. Symptoms of illness caused by biological toxins consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and digestive problems.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to supply sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
