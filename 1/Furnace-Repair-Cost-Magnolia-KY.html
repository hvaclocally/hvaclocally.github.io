<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, however many utilize the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a much better option. If the present system has not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and problems that led to the breakdown can be recognized and remedied, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
<p>Heavy manufacturing markets utilize a reasonably small portion of air conditioning professionals and other HVAC employees, but pay a few of the market's greatest earnings. Electrical power creating companies top the list, with an average wage of $34.09 per hour or $70,920 each year. Automobile parts manufacturers, aerospace makers and automobile manufacturers are all within a few cents of each other at around $31 per hour, or over $64,000 each year. Trains are another high-wage company, at approximately $29.33 per hour or $61,000 per year.<p>
