<p>Immediate effects may show up after a single exposure or repeated exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant effects are typically short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is merely removing the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also appear soon after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
