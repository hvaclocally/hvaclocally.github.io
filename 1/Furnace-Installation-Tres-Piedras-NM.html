<p>I am very satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years back and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment maker's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in location. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is typically difficult to measure, as one response specified the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or ac system do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the outcome of recurring use of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature deterioration, leading to holes and cracks. , if that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the part.. a very helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
