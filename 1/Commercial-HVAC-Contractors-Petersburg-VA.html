<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
