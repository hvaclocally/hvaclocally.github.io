<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.. Secondly like prolonged auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ.

Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found somebody to properly service and the system has actually been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
