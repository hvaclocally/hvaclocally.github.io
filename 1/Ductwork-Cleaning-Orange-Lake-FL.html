<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.
