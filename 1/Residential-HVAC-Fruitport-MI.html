<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
