<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
