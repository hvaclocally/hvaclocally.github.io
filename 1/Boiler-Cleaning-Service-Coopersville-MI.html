<p>One of the drawbacks of central heating is that it's possibly costly to install, specifically in an older home. Depending upon the type of unit set up, it can be noisy and trigger problems if you're highly allergic to dust. Furthermore, certain fuels and equipment might need special permits, and there is limited flexibility in case of altered heating requirements. During use, there is a time delay while heat is being transported from the heating unit to the living space.<p>
<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly greater wages for air conditioning tradespersons. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable environment, or simply a high level of competition for proficient trades.

Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the 5 highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 per year.<p>
