My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.
