<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not provide off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place in time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
