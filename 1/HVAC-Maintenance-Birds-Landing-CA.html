<p>Great Item! Shipment was kind of odd being that package was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was very lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we resolved problems. I would suggest this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

Radiant heat, for example, may be a much better suitable for your needs.<p>

<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
