<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine parts. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, visit Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
