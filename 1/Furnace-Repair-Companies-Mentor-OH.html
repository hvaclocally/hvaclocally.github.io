<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold might be residing in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. However a lot of the things individuals do-- or do not do-- can add to the stew of air-borne impurities in their homes and get worse asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
