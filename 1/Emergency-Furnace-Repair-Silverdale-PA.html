<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered by a Silverdale PA HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are very effective, due to the fact that ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is constantly at a continuous temperature.

Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE rates how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling result. Most ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for each unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
