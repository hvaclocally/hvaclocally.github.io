<p>Examine these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>

The radiators might be installed on walls or set up within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
