<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics lately, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>
