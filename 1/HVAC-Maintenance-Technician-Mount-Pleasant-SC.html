<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a referral later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
