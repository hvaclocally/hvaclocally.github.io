<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered by a Santa Ynez CA HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Ductless air conditioning is, obviously, suitable for houses without ducts, but is also a versatile option for a variety of other situations. Rather of pushing cool air through shafts in walls, attic and flooring, ductless systems circulate air directly to specific rooms. Extremely affordable, and energy-efficient, and providing higher control over when and where the air goes in your home, All Points Heating can assist you select the best ductless air conditioning system for your requirements.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
