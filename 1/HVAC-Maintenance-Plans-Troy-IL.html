<p>The primary reason homeowners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services used.

<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
