<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price great however Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized.

Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to supply thermal convenience inside. However, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside.
