<p>I'll begin with a natural gas furnace because it's the most typical heating unit in Seattle homes. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house through ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably simple procedure. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather pricey if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
