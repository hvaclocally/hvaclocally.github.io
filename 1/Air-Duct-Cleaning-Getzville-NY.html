Though specific guidelines have not been established for IAQ in the work place, the Environment, Health And Wellness Department (EHS) considers recommendations from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), American Industrial Health Association (AIHA), and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).<p>

PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While space air conditioning supplies maximum versatility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
