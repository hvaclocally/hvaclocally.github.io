<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power should not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, given that the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have an extremely comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not easy, because it takes into consideration not only the small power of the systems, however likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem. While installing a separate split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, because some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
