<p>Trane central air conditioners are understood for maintaining warranties and uses a basic 10-year warranty that covers both parts and labor. A Trane XR14 that has a 14 SEER rating in energy performance would cost anywhere from $4,800 to $6,800 to install.

<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can afford, so many Seattleites need to discover ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a terrible, terrible summer.<p>
<p>The primary health effect associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
