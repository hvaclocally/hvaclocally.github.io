<p>The probability of instant responses to indoor air toxins depends upon several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important influences. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends on individual sensitivity, which varies significantly from person to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after repeated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical contaminants also.<p>
<p>Many AC units come with a variety of special features that can further enhance performance and effectiveness. For instance, house owners might want to look for one that comes with an integrated filter light that will alert you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular function to look for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to minimize energy expenses a lot more. Naturally, more features imply higher central air conditioning costs.<p>
