<h3>Methods To Get the Most out of Your HVAC System in Appomattox VA</h3>
<p>When you and your family walk into your house in Sacramento, CA, are you as comfy as you can be? Do you find it to be either too cold during the winter season or too warm in locations during the summer?

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
