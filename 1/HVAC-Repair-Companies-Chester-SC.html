<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, a number of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>More typical in reasonably older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses electrical power, gas or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in private rooms. All-electric boilers can attain up to 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers must accomplish 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers must achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
