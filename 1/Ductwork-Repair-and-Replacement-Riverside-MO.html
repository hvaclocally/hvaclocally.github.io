<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
