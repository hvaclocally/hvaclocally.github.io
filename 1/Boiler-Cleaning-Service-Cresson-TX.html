From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some standard maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne pollutants flowing through your system. They can likewise keep your system performing well by helping reduce the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from building up on internal parts like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
