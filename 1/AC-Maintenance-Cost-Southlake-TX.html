<p>While contaminant levels from specific sources might not posture a significant health threat on their own, many homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a major threat from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Luckily, there are steps that many people can take both to decrease the risk from existing sources and to prevent new problems from happening. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to take actions that can reduce the level of indoor air contamination in your own home.<p>
<p>Immediate results might appear after a single exposure or duplicated direct exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant effects are treatable and generally short-term. Sometimes the treatment is simply removing the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise show up soon after exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the big picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality display can be set up to offer threshold notifies. If, for example, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might establish your tracking devices to inform you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the appropriate action to solve the situation immediately.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
