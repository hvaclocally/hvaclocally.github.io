<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring devices will send out the sensor data to the cloud, where you can access it through software.

<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
