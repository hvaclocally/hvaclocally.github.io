<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was kind of odd being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we dealt with problems. I would suggest this product to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
