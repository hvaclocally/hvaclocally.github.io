<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Oakland Michigan</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the go to. They suggested changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the new part.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>The bottom line is to secure your investment by only using the services of a licensed contractor or a certified agent from an organisation or seller to do the installation.

Do it right from the start and employ a certified individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
