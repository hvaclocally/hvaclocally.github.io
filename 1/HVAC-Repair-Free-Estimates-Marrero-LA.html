<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Air toxins can vary from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your animals to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air contaminant arising from natural gas that escapes into your home without being burned off. Older houses might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where wetness levels are typically greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, frequently referred to as central air" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floors covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
