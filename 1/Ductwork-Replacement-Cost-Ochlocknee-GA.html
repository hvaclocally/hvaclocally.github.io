<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
