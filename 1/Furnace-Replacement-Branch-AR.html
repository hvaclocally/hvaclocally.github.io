<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the main problem. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>
