<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, however it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have an unfavorable effect on occupants-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
