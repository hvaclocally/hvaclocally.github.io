<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same pollutants. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in physical and mental advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Children, infants, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults given that lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Children might have greater direct exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

More serious than many allergenic homes is the capability of mold to activate episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a major respiratory illness.<p>
