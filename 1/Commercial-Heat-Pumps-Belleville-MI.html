<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home.

Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
