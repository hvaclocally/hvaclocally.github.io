<p>If you set it too low, you're encouraging the development of mold in wet air. The heat dries the air, preventing mold growth and pollution. Of course, too-dry air can also irritate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
<p>Air pollutants can range from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your pets to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air contaminant arising from gas that leaves into your home without being burnt. Older homes may include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In cooking areas and bathrooms, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where wetness levels are typically higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, wall, ceiling, and floor coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to two days may become a source for mold development and should be discarded. Sometimes there is a moldy smell however mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can thrive in concealed or rarely accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the moisture problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the area using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
