<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside system as near the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

The system runs quietly and efficiently, however to have two major components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

Effectiveness ratings must be labeled with all units.

<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might pick to change the outside compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency system. Seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor unit if you do so. However, thinking about current changes in refrigerants and cooling designs, it might be wiser to change the entire system.<p>
