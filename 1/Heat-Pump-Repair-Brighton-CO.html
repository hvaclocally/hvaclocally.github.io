<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise controling the temperature of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>We added a brand-new 1500 sf workplace to perform our workshops and needed some heating. After contacting Integrity we were offered a great quote on a radiant flooring system. We were in a time crunch for upcoming occasion, and Tyler came right out and had us linked in a number of days. The systems works terrific and the new office space feels extremely comfy. It was a satisfaction working with such a professional company and would highly advise them to anybody trying to find HVAC.<p>

<p>This review is for replacing a 17 years of age AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who described our choices did an excellent job in ensuring we understood the benefits and drawbacks of each choice. The service technicians who installed the new system were fast and expert, while requiring time to ensure we understood how the new system worked. In general a very first rate experience.<p>
