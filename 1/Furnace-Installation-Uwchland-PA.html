<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

One of the primary locations where blockages start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
