<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive if your home or building has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Most well and city water does not generally consist of lead. Water normally picks up lead inside the house from household plumbing that is made with lead products.
