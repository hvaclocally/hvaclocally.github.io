<h3>Solar Heating System in Dawson Texas</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump.

An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty.

<p>I am really amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years earlier and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
