<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.. Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the system has actually been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
