<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts decades, considering that it is secured inside. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely.

The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
