<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
