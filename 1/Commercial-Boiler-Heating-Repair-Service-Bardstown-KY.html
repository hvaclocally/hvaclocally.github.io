<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold.

For instance, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the existence of feline irritant might cause an asthma attack in people with feline allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time fixing the problem, all the while describing whatever to me.

After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
