<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
