<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating unit. We decided on getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenditures.

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
