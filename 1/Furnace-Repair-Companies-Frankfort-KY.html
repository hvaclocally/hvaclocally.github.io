<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that devices that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening.

<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment maker's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in place. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is often hard to measure, as one reaction mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided.

For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering early wear and tear, leading to fractures and holes. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.  a really beneficial result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
