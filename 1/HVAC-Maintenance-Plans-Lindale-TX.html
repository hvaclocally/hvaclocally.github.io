In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
