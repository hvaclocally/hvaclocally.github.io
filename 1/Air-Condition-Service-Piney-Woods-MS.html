He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years back and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.
