Second of all, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make sure that an efficient wetness barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed if it becomes wet.<p>
