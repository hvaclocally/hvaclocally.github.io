<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
