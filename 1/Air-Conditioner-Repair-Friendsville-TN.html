<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Scott Hauncher, a partner at Huron Capital, said Pueblo searches for more than just additional income or scale when it makes acquisitions - it searches for companies that can broaden Pueblo's client base or offer a brand-new line of services.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in autos in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by licensed HVAC professionals. For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by numerous people.<p>
