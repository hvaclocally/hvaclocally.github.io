Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent gos to, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
