<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>

Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
