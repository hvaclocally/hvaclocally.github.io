<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can afford, so many Seattleites must find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.
