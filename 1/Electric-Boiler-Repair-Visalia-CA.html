This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
