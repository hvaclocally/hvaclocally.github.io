<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement tries to upsell you each time they come to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was 6 months before the present one ended. She didn't need a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
