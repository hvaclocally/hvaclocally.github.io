<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics recently, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
