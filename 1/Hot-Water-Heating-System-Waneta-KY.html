<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house.

<p>A geothermal heat pump uses a peaceful cooling and heating option that does not disturb your neighbors with noise. Additionally, the ground source heat pump is extremely durable and can last you for several years with simply a really little amount of maintenance, a huge distinction to the significant maintenance a more traditional system needs.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
