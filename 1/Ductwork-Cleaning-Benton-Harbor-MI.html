<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioning unit back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s below package to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards typically total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the initial cost of a system competitive with standard devices. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, throughout brand-new building (houses generally use between one and five heaps). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. However, brand-new installation practices are decreasing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to standard systems under the best conditions.<p>
