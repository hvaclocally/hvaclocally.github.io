<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not provide off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place gradually due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
