<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions because they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up. Because a system is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
