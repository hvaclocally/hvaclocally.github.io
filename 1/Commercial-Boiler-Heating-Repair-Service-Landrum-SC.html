<h3>HVAC Contractors in Landrum SC</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite HVACS on one of the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to examine circumstance & chose to go with them for the work. I more than happy to state that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise changed the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke to from starting to end were really professional, courteous and the work was very effectively done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Terrific service within 24 hr and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was very thorough and on-time in describing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn supplied fantastic customer service at the end of the appointment by discussing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance tasks we might want to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>The most typical kind of home heating system in the U.S. burns natural gas or lp to produce heat. With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least costly choice, however more recent systems can be very energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems usually attain a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, highly efficient gas heating systems can attain AFUE scores as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Only a professional can accurately identify why your furnace isn't starting. It's time to call an expert if at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something appears strange or you lose confidence. Likewise, if the procedure doesn't work, something else is wrong and you need a technician to examine the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you find you need to do it regularly, it's most likely time for an expert opinion.<p>
