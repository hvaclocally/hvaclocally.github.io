<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Etlan VA</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
