<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed.

When radon ends up being trapped in buildings and concentrations build up indoors, exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>
