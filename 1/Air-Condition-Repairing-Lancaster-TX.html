<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power ought to not exceed the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units greater than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%.

Simply put, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not simple, because it takes into account not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
