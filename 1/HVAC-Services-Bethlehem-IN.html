<p>A geothermal heat pump is among the most energy efficient methods of heating or cooling a home.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.

A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively.

Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
