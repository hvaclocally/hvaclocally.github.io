<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that gathers during summers. The best thing to do is making sure that the heating system burners are checked and cleaned completely prior to cooler seasons begin. Constantly make certain that the furnace is cleaned up yearly to avoid soot and condensation which causes burners to quit working effectively. If your furnace is in a very bad condition, perhaps it is time to start thinking about purchasing a brand-new one.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
