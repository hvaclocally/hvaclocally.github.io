<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
