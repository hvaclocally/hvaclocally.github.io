All of the current heating systems are a lot more energy-efficient than those set up even twenty years earlier.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
