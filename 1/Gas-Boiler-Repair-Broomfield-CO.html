<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can afford, so many Seattleites must discover ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in huge box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a harsh, cruel summer.<p>
<p>Start by checking out the installation manual and familiarizing yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. Most units include a set that consists of adjustable window extensions and metal mounting brackets. These parts will ensure an airtight and safe fit in the window opening. And for extra support, especially for larger air conditioners, consider acquiring a steel assistance bracket and install it to the outside house wall, straight listed below the windowsill.<p>
