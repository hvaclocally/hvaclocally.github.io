I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
