<h3>Benefits of Purchasing on Gas Furnaces in Salford PA</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes far more serious with lower outside temperatures, so heat pumps are typically installed in tandem with a more traditional form of heating, such as an electrical heater, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heat pump during harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used effectively during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
