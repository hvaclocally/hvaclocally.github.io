<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Because as much as 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated performance benefit. Because they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Because a system is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
