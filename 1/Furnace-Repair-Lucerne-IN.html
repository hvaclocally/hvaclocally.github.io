The germs forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, consisting of chlorine. Removal for Legionella outbreaks in commercial buildings differ, but often consist of very hot water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and in some cases flushes of heavy metal salts.
