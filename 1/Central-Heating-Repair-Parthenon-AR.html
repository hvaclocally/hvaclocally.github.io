<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems.

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
