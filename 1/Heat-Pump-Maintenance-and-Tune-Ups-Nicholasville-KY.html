<h3>HVAC Air Conditioning Service in Nicholasville KY</h3>

They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
