<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from procedures or products; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually.
