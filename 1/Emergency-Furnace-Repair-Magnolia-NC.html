<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ¬∞ C (40-55 ¬∞ F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
