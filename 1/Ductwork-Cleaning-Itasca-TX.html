<p>There are a few possibilities to discuss brief cycling in extremely cold weather. The most apparent is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the very low temperature levels. In some cases, the furnace will just run harder to maintain a warm climate for your home when the weather condition is very cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a damaged thermostat. Contact among our specialists if you require clarity on this issue.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of new homes are starting to include mechanical systems that bring outside air into the home. Some of these styles include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (also called air-to-air heat exchangers). To learn more about air-to-air heat exchangers, contact the Conservation and Renewable Energy Questions and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
