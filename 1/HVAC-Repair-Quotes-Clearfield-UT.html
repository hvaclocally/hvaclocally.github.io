<h3>Air Condition Installation in Clearfield UT</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
