<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors remove contaminants directly from the space where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably minimizes direct exposure to contaminants throughout cooking. Improper adjustment, often indicated by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame idea is blue. If you purchase a new gas stove or range, think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot burner that burns continually. Never ever use a gas stove to heat your home. When the fireplace is in usage, always make specific the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
