Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, floorings, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c unit to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
