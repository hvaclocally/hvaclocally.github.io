<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Due to the fact that as much as 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated performance advantage. Because they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions.

<p>The heatpump gained popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heat pumps can extract heat from various sources, such as environmental air, exhaust air from a structure, or from the ground.

They come in many different types: wall-mounted systems that are excellent for little spaces like restrooms, cove heating systems that are similar to baseboard heating units but are tucked safely up by the ceiling, and ceiling-mounted convected heat panels that offer a gentle sunshine-like warmth from above.<p>
