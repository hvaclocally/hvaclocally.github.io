<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>The primary reason house owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the amount of services provided. If the system is new and still under a producer's warranty, the cost may not be beneficial. Any significant repairs need to be covered under the producer's guarantee. However, some makers need regular maintenance as a regard to the warranty.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
