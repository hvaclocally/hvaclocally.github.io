Climate Pro is trusted and really cared about us and our situation. We came home one night to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that same night. Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could search for and acquire it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely appreciative to have a heated house again. What's most fantastic was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to help us right prior to a holiday, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my buddies.<p>

<h3>Boiler Installation in Gold Hill OR</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
