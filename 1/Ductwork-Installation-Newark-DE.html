Contaminants might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon going into your home from the ground below. An air contaminant might also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or individual care products.
