<p>Indoor environments are highly complex and structure occupants might be exposed to a range of pollutants (in the type of gases and particles) from office devices, cleaning items, construction carpets, activities and home furnishings, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outside contaminants. Other aspects such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how individuals respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, however it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
