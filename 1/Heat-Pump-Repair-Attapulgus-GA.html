<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
