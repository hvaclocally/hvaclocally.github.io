<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty.
