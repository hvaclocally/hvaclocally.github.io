<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was essential and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater since the service technicians believed they just didn't appear right and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely helpful in gathering info on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly handle the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
