The primary route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may get in close-by ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis.
