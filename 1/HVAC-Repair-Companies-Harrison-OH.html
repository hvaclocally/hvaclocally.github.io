<p>Next, and perhaps simply as essential when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air.

Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
