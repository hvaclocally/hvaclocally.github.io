<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to supply enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
