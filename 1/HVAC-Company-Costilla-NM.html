<h3>How to Limit the Costs of Air Conditioner Repair in Costilla NM</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very pleased that somebody as experienced as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to check the ac system before you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had methods to check AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
