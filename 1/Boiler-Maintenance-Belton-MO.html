<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Belton MO</h3>
<p>For whole house setups, it's tough, if almost difficult, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing home, especially a hydronic system. Localized radiant floor heat systems to be utilized in one or numerous rooms like restrooms, kitchen areas or laundry rooms are quickly refurbished with electric radiant floor heat.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in cars in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by lots of individuals.<p>
