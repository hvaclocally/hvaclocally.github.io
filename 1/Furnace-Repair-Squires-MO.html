<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience intermittent periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Switch off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the detach block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still does not work appropriately after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work fully unless you do this.<p>
