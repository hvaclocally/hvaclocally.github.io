<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of affordable ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up group was considerate of my home and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install assessment outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality.

You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
