<p>Trace was the service technician that looked after my semi annual maintenance today. Trace was on time, courteous, and appreciated my home by always wearing boot coverings when entering my house. He demonstrated the points of examination and also advised I have a UV light set up due to a small accumulation of mold accumulating in the air handler, which he completely cleaned up the outside and checked compressor coils as well as ensured the moisture discharge tube was clear by utilizing a cleaning liquid and a store vacuum. He also got rid of the leaves that built up inside the interior of the compressor unit and suggested an option to prevent it from continuing, which will do.I got a comprehensive e-mail report of the assessment describing all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is a property to Waychoff's and I highly advise him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
