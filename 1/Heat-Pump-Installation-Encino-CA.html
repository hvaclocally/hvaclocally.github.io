Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is sincere, reliable, and sensible on cost. It's difficult to discover an honest AC man and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
