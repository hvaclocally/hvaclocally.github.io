<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor in Austin IN</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>A/c service appointments consist of a long list of checks in, on and around your equipment. Knoechel Heating Company specialists will look at things that may be making your AC run inefficiently, such as refrigerant charge. They make certain specific areas of your ac system are clean, which can also help them operate more effectively. And, they check for security issues, so your electrical connections, filters and parts of the air conditioning system are running appropriately, helping prevent dangerous circumstances in your home. Combine these with a variety of other checks, and after the visit you can rest easy understanding that your air conditioning unit is all set to keep you comfy another year.<p>
