<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Flossmoor IL</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions.

<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. When the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and treat-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
