<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They met my requirements totally by offering a professional quote with choices, without pushing extra items. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also quickly followed up with the necessary assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>

This might be through a public offering, a sale to a big organisation in the field, and even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management.
