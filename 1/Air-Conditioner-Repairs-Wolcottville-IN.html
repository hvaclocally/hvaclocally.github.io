When used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of enabling heat to warm up the concrete piece below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes.
