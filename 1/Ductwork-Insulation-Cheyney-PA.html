<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment maker's to guarantee your factory guarantees stay in place.

For instance, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing early degeneration, leading to holes and fractures. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.  a really useful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
