<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be severe. They include delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, infants, and children are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults because lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the harmful impacts of lead. Kids might have higher exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
