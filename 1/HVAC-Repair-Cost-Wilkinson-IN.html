<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>The most common kind of house heating system in the U.S. burns gas or lp to produce heat. With a typical cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least pricey choice, but more recent systems can be extremely energy effective.
