<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones.

The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
