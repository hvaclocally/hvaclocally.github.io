<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>The primary health effect connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
