<p>Self-installation tends to produce more problems than it solves. In truth, it often triggers professional intervention anyhow to fix a few of the problems that were developed during the installation.

<p>A/c unit can create a great deal of water due to the fact that they eliminate wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In truth, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the location. To handle condensate problems, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
