Toxins might come from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon going into your house from the ground listed below. An air toxin could likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or moist carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or individual care products. Germs and viruses, pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
