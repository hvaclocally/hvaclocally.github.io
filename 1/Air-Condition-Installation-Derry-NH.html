First, you'll need one that is correctly sized for your home. A furnace that is too big will put out excessive heat for your system to deal with, and will trigger problems like short-cycling that can reduce its life. A furnace that is too small, on the other hand, will not be able to provide enough heat to keep your house comfortable.<p>
