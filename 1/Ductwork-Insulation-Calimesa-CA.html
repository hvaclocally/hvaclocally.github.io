<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Picture 6).<p>
