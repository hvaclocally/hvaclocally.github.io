<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise regulating the temperature level of the flooring. All electrical wiring for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that allow greater airflow from the outside, air quality tracking platforms and sensors, and new air purification technologies are becoming more common as available options in residential and commercial HVAC product bundles. Adoption of these innovations, nevertheless, has not been prevalent, as clients stay mainly unconcerned to the impacts of air quality on health and productivity.<p>

Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more affordable approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later on in this section.<p>
