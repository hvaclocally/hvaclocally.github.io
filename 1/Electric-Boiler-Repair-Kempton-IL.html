<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
