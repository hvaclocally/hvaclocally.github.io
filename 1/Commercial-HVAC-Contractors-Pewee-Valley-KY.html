<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, ceiling, floor, and wall coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 2 days may become a source for mold growth and should be disposed of. In some cases there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in hidden or rarely accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, chances are there will be mold growing nearby. Fix the moisture issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely tidy the location utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
