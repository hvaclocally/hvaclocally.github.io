<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product over time.

Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
