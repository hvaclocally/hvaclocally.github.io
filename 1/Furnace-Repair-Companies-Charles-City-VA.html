<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit toxins.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, human beings exhale carbon dioxide, which in small amounts is not harmful, but may become dangerous if high concentrations are enabled to accumulate. Germs or micro-organisms may also exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they might spread throughout the whole work environment or building by methods of the ventilation system.<p>
