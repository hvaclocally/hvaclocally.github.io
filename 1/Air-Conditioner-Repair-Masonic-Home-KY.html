<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to appropriately service and the unit has been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
