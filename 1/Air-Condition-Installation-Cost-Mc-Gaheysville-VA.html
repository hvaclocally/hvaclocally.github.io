<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood flooring joist system, beneath the wooded subsurface and final floor surface.

To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
