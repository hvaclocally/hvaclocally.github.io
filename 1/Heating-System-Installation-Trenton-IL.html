<p>Today's house convected heat systems take full advantage of infrared radiation. By far, the most common source of a radiator in a home is the flooring mass. Radiators can be locally located in one location like a restroom floor or be installed across the entire sub-surface of the home's floorings. Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heaters-- although ceiling radiators are usually utilized in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators. This typically results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides heat from the flooring up throughout the room with no cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
