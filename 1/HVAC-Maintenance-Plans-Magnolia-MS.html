<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in Magnolia MS?</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
