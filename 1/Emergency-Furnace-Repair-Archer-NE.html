We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to test the air conditioning unit before you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to test AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>I extremely advise using this service. Extremely reputable very great.
