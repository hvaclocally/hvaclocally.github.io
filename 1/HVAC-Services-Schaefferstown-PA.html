<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The objective is to offer sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
