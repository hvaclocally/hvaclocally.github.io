Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that secure your cooling system from flooding. One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good possibility; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace.
