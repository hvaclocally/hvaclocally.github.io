<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. The likelihood of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon a number of factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends on specific level of sensitivity, which varies enormously from individual to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to chemical or biological toxins after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the exact same duration. Basically, SEER supplies more information based upon how the EER performs in different temps. The greater the unit's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all home appliances.<p>
