Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
