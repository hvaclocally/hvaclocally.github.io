<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
