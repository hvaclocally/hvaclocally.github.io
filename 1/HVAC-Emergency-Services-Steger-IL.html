<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
