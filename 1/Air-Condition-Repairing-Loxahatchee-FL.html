<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
