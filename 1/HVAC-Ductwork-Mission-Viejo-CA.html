<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably simple process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite expensive.<p>
