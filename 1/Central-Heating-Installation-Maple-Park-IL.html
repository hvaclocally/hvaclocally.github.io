A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
