<p>Recent Evaluation: They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my requirements entirely by providing a professional quote with choices, without pressing extra items. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also quickly followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
