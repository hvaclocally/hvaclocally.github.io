Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure.
