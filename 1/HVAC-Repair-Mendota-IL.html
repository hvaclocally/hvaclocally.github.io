<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling.
