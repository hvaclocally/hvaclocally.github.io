One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are required to resist present, which then creates heat.<p>
