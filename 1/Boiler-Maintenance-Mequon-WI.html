<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, considering that a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
