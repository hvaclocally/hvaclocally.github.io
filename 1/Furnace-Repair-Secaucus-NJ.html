A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to appropriately service and the unit has been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
