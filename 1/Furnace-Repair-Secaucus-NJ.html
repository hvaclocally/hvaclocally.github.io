<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.  Secondly like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to appropriately service and the unit has been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
