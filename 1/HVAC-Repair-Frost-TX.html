<p>Developed to improve making procedure control in a printing plant, Provider's development controlled not just temperature however also humidity Carrier utilized his understanding of the heating of items with steam and reversed the procedure.

Later on, Provider's innovation was applied to increase performance in the work environment, and The Provider Cooling Company of America was formed to satisfy increasing need. Over time, air conditioning became utilized to enhance comfort in automobiles and houses also.<p>
