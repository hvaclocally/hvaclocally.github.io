<p>My oldest boy always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think about anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
