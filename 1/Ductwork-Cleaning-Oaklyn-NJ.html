<h3>Direct Purchase HVAC Equipment in Oaklyn NJ</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We picked getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is among our most significant energy costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not provide them.  Second of all like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to correctly service and the unit has been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
