<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
