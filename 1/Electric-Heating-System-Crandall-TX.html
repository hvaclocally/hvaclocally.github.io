<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and area of pollutant direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This enables products to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Area control includes moving the contaminant source away from occupants and even moving vulnerable residents.<p>
<p>Some health results may appear shortly after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures to a contaminant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate effects are generally short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is just getting rid of the individual's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined.

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly easy to measure surrogate for indoor toxins released by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high inside your home may trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
