<p>A/c and refrigeration are supplied through the elimination of heat. Heat can be eliminated through radiation, convection, or conduction The heat transfer medium is a refrigeration system, such as water, air, ice, and chemicals are described as refrigerants A refrigerant is utilized either in a heat pump system in which a compressor is utilized to drive thermodynamic refrigeration cycle, or in a totally free cooling system which utilizes pumps to flow a cool refrigerant (usually water or a glycol mix).<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump cost is much more than other heat pump types when setting up the whole system. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems.
