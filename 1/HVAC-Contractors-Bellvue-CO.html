(If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
