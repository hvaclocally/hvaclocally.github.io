<p>As noted, inappropriate temperature level and humidity levels, and too much or too little air flow might likewise add to worker health problems. Temperature levels must range from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air flow must be avoided. Maintenance of appropriate temperature levels and humidity levels and correct air flow will help to lower the occurrence of upper breathing symptoms, and, possibly, skin rashes.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are prone to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot beside the radiators.
