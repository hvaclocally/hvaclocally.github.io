<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or laboratory environments, rather than commercial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It may also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to specific areas.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. Therefore, a professional service person should be required almost any maintenance aside from routine cleaning. Central air conditioning conditioners need to be professionally checked and adjusted prior to the start of every cooling season. However, do not let your maintenance end with this yearly checkup. While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system running at peak effectiveness.<p>

<p>A primary consider the avoidance of health symptoms is an efficient, appropriately developed and operating ventilation system.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor unit rather of ducting air directly from the outside unit.
