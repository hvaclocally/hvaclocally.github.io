He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow.

Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have.

Finally found someone to properly service and the system has actually been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
