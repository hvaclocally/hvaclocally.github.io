<p>Usually, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is wintry, the evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. Also, if the ac system smells bad, there might be germs accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat far from your house. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to replace the ac system's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Another option to oil heaters are gas furnaces While oil is generally used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have an option in between the two types.

<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely delighted that somebody as knowledgeable as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioner before you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had methods to evaluate AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
