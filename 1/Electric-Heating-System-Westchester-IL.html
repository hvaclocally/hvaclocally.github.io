<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heatpump work effectively in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties. Running on electrical power, a heatpump is a cost-effective solution utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, but in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air currently inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and presses it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>For instance, issues emerge when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in appropriate quantities of outdoor air. Inadequate ventilation also occurs if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or put in such a way that outdoor air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building residents. Poorly located outside air intake vents can also generate air contaminated with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>
