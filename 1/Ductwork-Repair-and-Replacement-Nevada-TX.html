In jobs where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It might also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private spaces.<p>
<p>Location the solar storage tank near the conventional hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, ensure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are available.

Set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
