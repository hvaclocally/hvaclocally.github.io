<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. However, a number of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
