<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the job based only on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few sensible ones got. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex effectively encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install evaluation results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it changed (also Provider).<p>

A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Car Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>

<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung out fixing the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
