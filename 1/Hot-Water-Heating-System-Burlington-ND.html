They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
