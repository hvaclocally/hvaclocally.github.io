<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was type of odd being that package was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: buy advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we solved concerns. I would recommend this product to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
