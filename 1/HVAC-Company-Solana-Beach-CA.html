<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
