<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. When they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and tied them into a hot water supply, glowing heat systems have been around since the days of the Romans. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping machine to circulate hot water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the harmony of the flooring heat moved heat to other posts in the rooms, including the human occupants.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
