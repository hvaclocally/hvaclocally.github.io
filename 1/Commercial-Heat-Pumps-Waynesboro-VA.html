<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they give me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
