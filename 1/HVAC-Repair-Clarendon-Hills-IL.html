Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. For that reason, a professional service person should be required nearly any maintenance aside from regular cleaning. Central air conditioning conditioners should be expertly checked and adjusted prior to the beginning of every cooling season.

While there aren't lots of repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system running at peak effectiveness.<p>
