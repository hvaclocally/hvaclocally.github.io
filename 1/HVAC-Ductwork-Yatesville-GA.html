<p>Measurement procedures are being established and demonstrated to evaluate building ventilation and indoor contaminant concentrations. These procedures range from advanced tracer gas methods used primarily in developing research study efforts to less involved procedures that can be employed by constructing operators.

The efforts in which these treatments are demonstrated in the field has led to the development of an important database of building ventilation and indoor air quality efficiency.<p>
