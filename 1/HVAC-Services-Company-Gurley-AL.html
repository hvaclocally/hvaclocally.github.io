<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
