<h3>Central Air Conditioner Installation in Oakhurst OK</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
