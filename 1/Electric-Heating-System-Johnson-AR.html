<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Do not place the condenser under a deck or completely confine it because it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow constraint will decrease the unit's efficiency. You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies heat from the flooring up throughout the room with no cold spots or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit toxins.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
