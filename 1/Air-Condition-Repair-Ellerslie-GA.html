<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>There are two primary types of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's known in the house heating company. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are required to withstand current, which then generates heat.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices normally lasts decades, given that it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical standards get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
<p>PE firms tend to run with the objective of selling or spinning off a company at some time.

Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, earlier this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for 3 years before that.<p>
