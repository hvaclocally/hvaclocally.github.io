<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make sure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the problem.<p>
