<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is improperly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in homes can also result from lead dust from outside sources, including infected soil tracked inside, and usage of lead in specific indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as important as a regular oil change in your vehicle. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter once every three months. During high usage months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>
