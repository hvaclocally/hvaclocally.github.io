<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, a lot of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Nevertheless, given that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is really warmed, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
