<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable higher air flow from the outside, air quality monitoring platforms and sensors, and brand-new air filtration technologies are becoming more common as readily available options in commercial and residential HVAC item packages.
