<h3>AC Service in Hercules CA</h3>
<p>As noted, incorrect temperature level and humidity levels, and too little or excessive air flow might likewise add to worker health problems. Temperature level levels need to range from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30% and 60%.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them until they have actually been effectively dried. If items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
