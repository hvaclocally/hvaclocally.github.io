<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the go to. They advised replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective.

<p>A geothermal heating unit does not generate its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as oil, coal, or gas. Instead, it takes in heat from within the earth. Additionally, a geothermal cooling and heating system utilizes considerably less electricity compared to a basic electric heat-resistance heat pump. This makes a geothermal heater an attractive service to cut your carbon footprint, offering a favorable impact on the environment.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
