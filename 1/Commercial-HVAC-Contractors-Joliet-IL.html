<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>

If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next action is to thaw your air conditioning equipment.
