<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.
