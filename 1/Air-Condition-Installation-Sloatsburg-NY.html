<p>Central air conditioning conditioners are more effective than space a/c unit. In addition, they are out of the way, peaceful, and practical to run.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
