We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
