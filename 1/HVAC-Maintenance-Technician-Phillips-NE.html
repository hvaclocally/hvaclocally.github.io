It takes about six months of close observation to see how typically your air conditioning filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better ideal choice on how often your HVAC filters require replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less often you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with only one a/c filter need replacing more frequently.<p>
