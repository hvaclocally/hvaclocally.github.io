In a consisted of system like a home, the warmer objects naturally heat the cooler ones until a balance is accomplished.<p>
<p>There's a big difference in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common form of house heating-- convection.

Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
