<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service in Oakland FL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
