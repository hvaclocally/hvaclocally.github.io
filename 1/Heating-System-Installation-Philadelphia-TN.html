<h3>Turning to the Ideal Company for the Right Furnace Repair in Philadelphia TN</h3>
<p>Among the main reasons a furnace will run constantly is since something is unclean or stopped up Prior to trying to repair any issue, take time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". Inspect the furnace blower for obstructing and clean it if the air filter is great to go. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it if this does not work. If you still can not find out why your furnace keeps running, call an experienced technician.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
