<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>
