<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it pertains to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size.

On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to correctly cool the house on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
