<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
