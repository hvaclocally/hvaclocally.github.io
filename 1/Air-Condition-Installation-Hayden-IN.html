If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
