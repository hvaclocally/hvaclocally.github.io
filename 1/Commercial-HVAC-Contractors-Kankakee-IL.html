<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your car. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. During high use months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>

<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Kankakee IL</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We picked getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
