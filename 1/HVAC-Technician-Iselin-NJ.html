Improper change, frequently shown by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue.

Never utilize a gas range to heat your house. Always make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>
