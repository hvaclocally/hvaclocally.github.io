<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside. Most house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house.

Local bathroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate pollutants straight from the space where the fan is located and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
