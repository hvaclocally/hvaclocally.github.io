<p>Prior to you pick a contractor, think about quotes from at least 3 to 5 reliable contractors. Consult your state's contractor's licensing board online to ensure that no consumer problems have been submitted and that the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is legitimate and active. Compare the various furnace effectiveness rankings advised by the individual contractors to choose the design and system that finest suits your energy needs. Remember that energy-star ranked equipment will conserve you money in the end but might involve a higher up-front cost.<p>
<p>Once every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you should get your HVAC system visually examined at least. This inspection is an essential element of HVAC maintenance.
