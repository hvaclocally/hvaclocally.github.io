<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
