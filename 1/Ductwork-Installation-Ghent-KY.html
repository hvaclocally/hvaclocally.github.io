<p>There are lots of sources of indoor air pollution in any house. These include combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, coal, tobacco, and wood products; structure materials and home furnishings as diverse as deteriorated, asbestos-containing insulation, moist or damp carpet, and cabinetry or furnishings made of specific pushed wood products; products for home cleaning and maintenance, personal care, or pastimes; central heating and cooling systems and humidification devices; and outside sources such as radon, pesticides, and outside air pollution.<p>
<p>To be sincere, few of the facilities supervisors who utilize our indoor air quality tracking service pertained to us because of that. More often than not they were at first interested in remotely keeping an eye on some other element of their buildings, such as energy use, in an effort to cut expenses. It wasn't till later on, as they continued working with us, that they learnt more about and implemented indoor air quality monitoring to offer a healthier, much safer structure environment-- and to head off the unfavorable repercussions related to indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>The most hazardous asbestos fibers are too little to be visible. After they are breathed in, they can remain and build up in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be fatal). Symptoms of these diseases do not show up until many years after exposure started. Most people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some industrialized illness from exposure to clothing and devices brought home from task websites.<p>
