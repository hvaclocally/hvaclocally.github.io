<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than commercial or outside settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It might likewise include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to individual areas.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning system and fridges used combustible or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
