<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was 6 months prior to the current one ended. She didn't need a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
