<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
