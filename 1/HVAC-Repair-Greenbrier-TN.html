<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost.
