<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Tulsa OK</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems need relatively little attention. However, similar to any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is important to keep the system operating efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system are similar to those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank ought to be looked for leaks, the system should be flushed periodically to eliminate tank and collected impurities (scaling in tough water locations). The systems must be examined a minimum of twice annually for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to eliminate dust gathered in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
