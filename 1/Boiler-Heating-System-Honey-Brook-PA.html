<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate since it just takes more electricity to run a larger system. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
