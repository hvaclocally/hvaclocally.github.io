<p>I have been using them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event.

He is truthful, trustworthy, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 must be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements utilized for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
