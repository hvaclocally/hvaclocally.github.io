By contrast, replacing a furnace and checking filter can typically be done in just a few minutes, often with no tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
