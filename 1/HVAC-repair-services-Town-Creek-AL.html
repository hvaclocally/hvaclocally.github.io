For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the higher temperature levels often utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to provide thermal convenience inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels inside your home.
