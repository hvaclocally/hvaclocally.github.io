<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heating systems, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>
