<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
