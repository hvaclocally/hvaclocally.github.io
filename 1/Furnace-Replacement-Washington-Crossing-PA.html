<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the big image" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality display can be established to supply threshold alerts.

From there you can take the suitable action to fix the situation instantly.<p>
