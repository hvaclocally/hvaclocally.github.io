The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Different HVAC contractors may differ their service offering a little in a different way from other companies. An expert, qualified and trained HVAC technician ought to be able to assist with three primary locations: maintenance, repair and installation.
