<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
