<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them till they have been effectively dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
<p>If the AC does not shut off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't produce heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place with time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to work till you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those procedures consist of bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. If several of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
