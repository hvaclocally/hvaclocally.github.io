<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as near your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>If your a/c unit is more than 8 years old, repair is most likely not worth the cost, unless it's an easy problem like particles obstructing the condenser system or a used fan belt.

<p>First of all, The after hours addressing service agent, John, was expert and very polite. Secondly, Gracion W is a prompt, educated technician. He was at my house within the time he provided me, fixed the issue while explaining the problem then remained several minutes to ensure it was working effectively. The concern was repaired in a matter of time that I have actually never ever seen before while being a property owner for ten years. I also advise one of the Defense Strategies, which I belong to, if you like to save cash. Thank you." Karen P.<p>
