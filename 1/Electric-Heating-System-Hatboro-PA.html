In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads.

<p>Generally the most reliable way to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions.
