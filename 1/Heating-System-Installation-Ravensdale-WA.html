<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating devices can last for many years.

<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Ravensdale WA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
