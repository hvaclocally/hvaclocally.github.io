<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate terrific however Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized.

An oversize compressor also costs more to run since it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And an oversize system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has a possibility to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
