<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the possible to adversely impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, germs, and really small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor ought to assess and, if essential, upgrade the structure envelope. For example, he may seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation may be a more reliable service to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. Therefore, an expert service person need to be called for nearly any maintenance besides regular cleaning.

While there aren't lots of repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system running at peak effectiveness.<p>
