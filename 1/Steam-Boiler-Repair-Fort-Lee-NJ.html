<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you need to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
