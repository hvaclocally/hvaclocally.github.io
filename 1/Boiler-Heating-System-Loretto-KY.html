In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is dedicated to providing a work environment that is devoid of recognized risks and to examination complaints that may be related to bad indoor air quality (IAQ). Though specific policies have not been established for IAQ in the work location, the Environment, Health and Safety Department (EHS) considers suggestions from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), American Industrial Health Association (AIHA), and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and A/c Engineers (ASHRAE).<p>

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
