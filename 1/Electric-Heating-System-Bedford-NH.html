During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, a number of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

The very best central air conditioning conditioner you can purchase today will use 30-50% less energy than one acquired in 1975 while delivering the same amount of cooling.<p>
