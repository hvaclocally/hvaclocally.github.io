<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor unit as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work.

<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
