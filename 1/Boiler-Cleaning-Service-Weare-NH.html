<h3>AC Replacement Service in Weare NH</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: They were excellent! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested.

The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise promptly followed up with the needed examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
