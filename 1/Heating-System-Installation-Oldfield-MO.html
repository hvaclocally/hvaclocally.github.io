Permeable materials, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 48 hours might end up being a source for mold development and must be disposed of. Sometimes there is a moldy odor however mold can not be seen.

Fix the moisture problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the location utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
