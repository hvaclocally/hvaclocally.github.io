<p>If you discover a decline in heat output, initially make sure the air filter is clean and in great condition. Next, inspect other components of the furnace for any build-up of debris, dirt and dust, an inexpensive repair that can help boost efficiency. Also, inspect the vents and ducts for blockage. Lastly, make certain the thermostat is working and positioned appropriately. Try moving it far from direct sunlight given that this might affect temperature level readings on the thermostat and trigger it to misread the temperature in your home. If this occurs, your thermostat will shut off the furnace prematurely and leave your house feeling cold. You may also need to inspect your insulation to ensure that warm air does not get away from your space through numerous openings.<p>
