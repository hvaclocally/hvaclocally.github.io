<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer.

This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Air conditioner manufacturers generally make rugged, high quality products. Begin by inspecting any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the unit cool down for about 5 minutes prior to resetting any breakers.
