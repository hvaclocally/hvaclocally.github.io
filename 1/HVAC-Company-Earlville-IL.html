<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often described as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is described as radiant heat.<p>
