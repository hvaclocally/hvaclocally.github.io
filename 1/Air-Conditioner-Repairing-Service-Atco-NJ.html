<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
