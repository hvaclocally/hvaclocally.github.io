<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. Attempt a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
<p>Numerous AC units feature a number of special features that can even more enhance efficiency and performance. For example, property owners might want to try to find one that includes an integrated filter light that will notify you when the air filter needs to be altered. Another popular feature to search for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on during the night to lower energy costs much more. Naturally, more features mean higher central air expenses.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by people and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
