The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future.

<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
