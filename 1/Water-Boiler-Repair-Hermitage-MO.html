<p>Seattle heaters can run nine months of the year.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Heating is likewise among the biggest energy customers in your house, so property owners who may be purchasing a new furnace must considering replacing it with a newer, more energy-efficient model to save money and help the environment.
