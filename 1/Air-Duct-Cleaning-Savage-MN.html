<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

First, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
