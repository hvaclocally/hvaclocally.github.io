<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently greater earnings for air conditioning tradesmen. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable environment, or simply a high level of competition for proficient trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's highest typical salaries for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year.

The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least once a week, and 34 percent usage candles or incense that often, our nationally representative survey found.
