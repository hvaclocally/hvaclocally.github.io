Their techs are extremely knowledgeable and professional. Costs are sensible. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a brand-new air handler and condenser today.

<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
