<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While room a/c provides optimum versatility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
