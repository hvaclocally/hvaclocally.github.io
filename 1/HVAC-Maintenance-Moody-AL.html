You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results by means of a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to figure out.<p>

<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ might see musty or unpleasant odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
