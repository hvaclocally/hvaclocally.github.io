<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
