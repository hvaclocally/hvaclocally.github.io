<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
