<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
