<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Additionally, tidy and even vacuum repeatedly in the location where your heating unit is located. Although you may believe that emptying the space of all items that might catch fire sooner or later provides adequate security, in some cases other scrap such as lint and dust might collect inside the furnace which might cause a fire. Excessive lint and dust will also block your filter earlier than it should be which will be a blow to your budget plan as you will need to repair or change the equipment.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are prone to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot beside the radiators. This typically leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides heat from the floor up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>
