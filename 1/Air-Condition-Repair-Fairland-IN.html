<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
