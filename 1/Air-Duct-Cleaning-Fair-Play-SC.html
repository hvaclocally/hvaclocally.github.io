<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters homes through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains pipes, and sumps. When radon ends up being trapped in structures and concentrations develop inside, direct exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>
<h3>Leaking Ductwork in Fair Play South Carolina</h3>
<p>Using air filters can trap a few of the air toxins. The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable Energy area suggests that "Air Purification must have a Minimum Performance Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to reduce the amount of dust that reaches the damp coils. Dust can act as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can decrease the performance of the coils.<p>
<p>The payback for a system can vary from 2-10 years, while the lifetime of a system can be 18-23 years, practically double a traditional system. Furthermore renewable energy systems add value to the equity of your home. There are US tax refunds for energy performance improvements, including a 30% federal tax credit, and lots of state and energy companies use incentives.

Additional TEAM research studies show that while individuals are utilizing items consisting of natural chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to very high contaminant levels, and raised concentrations can continue the air long after the activity is completed.<p>

<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, given that it is secured inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
