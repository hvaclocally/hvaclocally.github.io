<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
