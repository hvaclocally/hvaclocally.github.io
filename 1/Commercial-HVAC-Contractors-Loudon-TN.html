<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
