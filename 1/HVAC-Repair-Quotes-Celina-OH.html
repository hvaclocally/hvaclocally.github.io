No matter what HVAC system you utilize to heat your home, trust us for all your heating requires. Our technicians have the experience to finish the job, no matter the size of your system.

<p>The very first air conditioning system and fridges employed poisonous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 major elements fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>In most cases, if materials have stopped working to dry out several days after the suspected water event, mold growth is thought within wall cavities even if it is not right away noticeable. Through a mold examination, which may include destructive evaluation, one must have the ability to figure out the presence or lack of mold. In a scenario where there shows up mold and the indoor air quality might have been jeopardized, mold remediation may be needed. Mold screening and inspections ought to be carried out by an independent private investigator to prevent any dispute of interest and to insure accurate outcomes; free mold testing used by removal companies is not recommended.<p>
