<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on numerous home effectiveness upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's product and services was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to perform the needed electrical improvements to save on cost.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.  Secondly like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required skills to do the task and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of.

Lastly found someone to effectively service and the unit has been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
