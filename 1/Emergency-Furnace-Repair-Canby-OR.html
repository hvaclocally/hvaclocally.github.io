<p>Another technique to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home.

Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors eliminate contaminants directly from the space where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
