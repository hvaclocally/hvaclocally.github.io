<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent gos to, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
