The reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
