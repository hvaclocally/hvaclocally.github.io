<h3>HVAC Technician Near Me in Mount Saint Francis Indiana</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Benzene is a known human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are environmental tobacco smoke, saved fuels and paint supplies, and auto emissions in connected garages. Actions that will minimize benzene exposure consist of getting rid of smoking cigarettes within the home, offering maximum ventilation during painting, and disposing of paint supplies and special fuels that will not be utilized instantly.<p>
