Today's furnaces are ranked 90% efficiency or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which might be rated as low as 80% effectiveness, this can suggest significant savings in yearly heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or greater capability depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>A routine furnace tune up can optimize performance and offer longer long lasting home heating. However, there are times when a simple maintenance call can recognize an issue that will need a substantial investment to fix. Then, it's choice time. Do you make the costly repair and delight in continued convenience from your present heater? Or, do you make an even bigger financial dedication to replacing the furnace? The decision to repair or replace is up to you, and often it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, considering the age of the equipment, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely provides greater energy effectiveness and includes service warranty protection.<p>
