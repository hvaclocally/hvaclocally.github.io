<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price terrific but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

Symptoms of some illness, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise show up soon after exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.)
