<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by individuals and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
