The average summer temperature to arrive at the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the right SEER ranking for your location, deduct 2 points for every single 10 degrees over 83.

<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless poisonous gas. Since it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can eliminate you before you are aware it is in your home.
