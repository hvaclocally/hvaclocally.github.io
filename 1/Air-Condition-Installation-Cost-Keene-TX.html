<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. You can prevent all these issues by ensuring that your system is examined routinely, as this will avoid even small repairs from becoming huge problems. Try to a minimum of cleanup and examine your furnace as often as the developer recommends. Also, take extreme preventative measures while attempting to carry out any diy repairs to avoid health threats.

<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
