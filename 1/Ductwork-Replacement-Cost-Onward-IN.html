<p>When installing over concrete pieces, we advise utilizing our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by functioning as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of allowing heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from processes or products; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a brand-new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of brand-new homes are beginning to include mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home. A few of these designs include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (likewise known as air-to-air heat exchangers). For more information about air-to-air heat exchangers, contact the Preservation and Renewable Energy Query and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
