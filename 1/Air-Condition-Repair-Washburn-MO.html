<h3>Compact Air Conditioner in Washburn MO</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. With time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors altered to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Numerous AC units come with a number of special features that can further improve efficiency and performance. For instance, property owners might wish to search for one that comes with a built-in filter light that will signal you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular function to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on during the night to decrease energy expenses a lot more. Of course, more features suggest higher central air costs.<p>
