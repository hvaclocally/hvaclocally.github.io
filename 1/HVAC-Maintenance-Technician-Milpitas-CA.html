<p>The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air contaminants depends on several aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential influences.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ¬∞ C (40-55 ¬∞ F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
