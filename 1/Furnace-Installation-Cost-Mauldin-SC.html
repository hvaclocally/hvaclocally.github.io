<h3>Appropriate Things To Look Out For In Your Mauldin SC Commercial HVAC Service Provider</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>

For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by numerous individuals.<p>
