<p>Info provided in this security guide is based upon current clinical and technical understanding of the concerns provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. Buildings constantly evolve as a result of the modifications in the environment around them as well as the occupants, products, and activities within them. The various surface areas and the air inside a building are constantly communicating, and this interaction results in changes in each. For example, we might see a window as altering somewhat with time as it becomes filthy, then is cleaned, builds up dirt again, is cleaned again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see might be developing as an outcome of the interactions amongst the wetness, chemicals, and biological materials discovered there.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
