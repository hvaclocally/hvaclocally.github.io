<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>We suggest utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. When utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money.

By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
