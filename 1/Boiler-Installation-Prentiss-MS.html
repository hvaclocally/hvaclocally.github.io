Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
