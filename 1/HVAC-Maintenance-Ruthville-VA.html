The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Electric radiant floor heater lend themselves well to renovations, although they're commonly used in brand-new home construction.
