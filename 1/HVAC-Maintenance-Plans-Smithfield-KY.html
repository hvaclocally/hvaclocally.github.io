<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>

From here you can execute systems that enable you to take home more earnings at the end of the day.<p>
