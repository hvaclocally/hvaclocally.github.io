<p>The majority of well and city water does not usually contain lead. Water generally gets lead inside the house from household plumbing that is made with lead materials. The only way to understand if there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked. Contact the local health department or the water provider to find out how to get the water evaluated. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
