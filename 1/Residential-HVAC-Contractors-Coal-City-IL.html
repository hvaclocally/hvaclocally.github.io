<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. Just adding refrigerant is not a service if it leaks. A qualified technician ought to repair any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the correct amount of refrigerant. Remember that the performance and performance of your air conditioning system is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the maker's specification, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate terrific however Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Repair in Coal City Illinois</h3>
<p>As a skilled HVAC specialist, we suggest you have your systems examined and routine maintenance carried out two times annually, when in the Spring (prior to cooling season) and as soon as in the Fall (prior to heating season). It goes without stating the security and convenience of your family or office personnel are important factors. Keeping what is probably the most crucial and pricey system in your house (heating and cooling) correctly maintained will help keep your most significant financial investment of your life in excellent shape.<p>
<p>There is a needed balance in making your choice though as systems with higher AFUE scores typically feature higher cost. So, make certain to decide based upon how often you will utilize your heating unit, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year. For the majority of temperate environments with low heating loads in the winter, having an incredibly high rated heater is not always required.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
