<h3>Central Heating Systems in Hopewell VA</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>We look at ideas before we offer recommendations to replace rather than repair a heating system. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be losing money by not changing the older unit.<p>
