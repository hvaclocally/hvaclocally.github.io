<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure.

The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
