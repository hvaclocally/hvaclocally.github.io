<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
