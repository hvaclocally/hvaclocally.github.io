<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an air-borne item of a biological contaminant. Biological impurities in the house might consist of mold, germs, infections, mites, and pollen. Bioaerosols released into the air can be distributed throughout the home by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can cause infectious illness such as Legionnaires' illness.
