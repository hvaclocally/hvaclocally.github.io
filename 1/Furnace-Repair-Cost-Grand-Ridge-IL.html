<p>The very first air conditioning unit and fridges employed poisonous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to deadly mishaps when they leaked.

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
