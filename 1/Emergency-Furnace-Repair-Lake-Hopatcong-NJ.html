<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on.

Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
