<p>We look at clues before we offer guidance to change rather than repair a heater. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy costs are higher every year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering money by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from items or procedures; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
