<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most typical heater in Seattle homes.
