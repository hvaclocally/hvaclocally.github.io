<p>A hydronic glowing floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes set up under the floor or right within the floor surface area itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the floor mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not rely on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>
