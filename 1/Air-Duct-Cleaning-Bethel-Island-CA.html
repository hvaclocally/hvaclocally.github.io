<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in Bethel Island CA?</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
