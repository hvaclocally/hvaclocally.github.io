<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, because it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
