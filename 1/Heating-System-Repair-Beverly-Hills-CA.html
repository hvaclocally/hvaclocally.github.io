<p>Power Vac America supplies commercial, commercial, institutional, residential and marine air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services. The key part of your cooling is the outside unit. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending upon its positioning on your home and its upkeep, it may sustain some damage during the winter season. The majority of the time, this just includes some accumulation of dirt and particles, which is pretty simple to get rid of. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will clean off the exterior of the unit and guarantee that there is no rust, damage from built up moisture, or excessive wear to the exterior. They might advise that you trim overgrown trees or bushes to guarantee adequate air flow around the system.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
