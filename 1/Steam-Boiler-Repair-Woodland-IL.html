<p>Another approach to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming indoors.

Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors get rid of impurities straight from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
