<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Benefits of Investing on Gas Furnaces at Attleboro MA</h3>
<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are as different as the different houses they serve (single household houses, duplexes, mobile houses, apartments, high-rise condominiums, row real estate, etc.). No matter what the kind of home HVAC system, adequate air circulation (ventilation), proper filtering, and humidity control all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will ensure that it is operating securely and not adding to or triggering an indoor air issue.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Maintenance in Attleboro MA</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite A/C on one of the hottest days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to examine situation & decided to opt for them for the work. I more than happy to say that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but also replaced the heating system which was old. Everyone we spoke to from starting to end were extremely expert, considerate and the work was really effectively done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>We have actually been using Keefe's for several years and have constantly been exceptionally pleased. They offer exceptional repair set up and the customer care is fantastic. We just recently had an issue with an older unit and contacted us to set up a day and time to have it inspected. They sent James Bell and he was terrific. He made the effort to describe our alternatives cost differences and was very educated expert and helpful. Delighted consumers. " Mathew Licausi.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement tries to upsell you each time they come to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for seven years, although it was 6 months before the present one expired. She didn't need a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
