To make certain the unit you select is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation quote to identify the exact kind of heat and cooling system that's perfect for your home-we do not simply change it with the same size system you currently have. These calculations take into account things such as the size of your home, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is essential so the system isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
