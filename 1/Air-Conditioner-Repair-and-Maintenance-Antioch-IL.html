<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we suggest using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when used in combination with underfloor heating by serving as a really efficient thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of enabling heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes.
