<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as merely glowing systems.

When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>
