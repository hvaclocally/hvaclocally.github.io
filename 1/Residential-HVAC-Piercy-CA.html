<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house residents. Unlike other kinds of air conditioning unit, evaporative coolers depend on the outdoors air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be permitted to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain.<p>
