<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge pollutants.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
