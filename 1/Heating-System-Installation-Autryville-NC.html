<p>Before you go out and buy an air conditioning system, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be installing the a/c unit? If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioner be? Too big and you'll encounter issues with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and shorten its life. Too small and your air conditioning system won't be able to cool your house properly. When shopping for a new AC system, these are just a few of the factors that you need to take into account.

<p>The main reason house owners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the quantity of services used. If the system is new and still under a producer's guarantee, the cost may not be rewarding. Any major repairs need to be covered under the producer's guarantee.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
