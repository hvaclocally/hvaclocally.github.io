<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, however to have two major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>CARBOHYDRATE is actively involved in the development of green structure standards and indoor air quality standards. CARB also manages indoor air cleaners so that consumers can be guaranteed of their security. CARBOHYDRATE also performs and sponsors research study into all elements of indoor air quality, with a focus on identifying levels of exposure to harmful indoor air toxins, and seeking ways to lower that exposure and avoid.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to offer adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
