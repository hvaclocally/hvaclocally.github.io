<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As an initial step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Since the 1980s, makers of HVAC devices have actually been making an effort to make the systems they produce more efficient. This was originally driven by rising energy expenses, and has actually more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental concerns. In addition, enhancements to the HVAC system effectiveness can also assist increase occupant health and efficiency. 21 In the United States, the EPA has imposed tighter constraints over the years.

<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.)

For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering early degeneration, leading to holes and fractures. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.  an extremely advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
