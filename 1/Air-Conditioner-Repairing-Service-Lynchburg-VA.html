<p>I confess I haven't done the math lately, but I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they offer me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>

<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce contaminants.)
