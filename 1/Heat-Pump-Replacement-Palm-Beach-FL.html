<p>The heat pump acquired popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heat pumps can extract heat from numerous sources, such as ecological air, exhaust air from a structure, or from the ground.

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as vital as a regular oil change in your car. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. During high use months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>
