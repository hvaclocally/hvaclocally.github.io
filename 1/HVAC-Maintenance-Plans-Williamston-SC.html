<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
