<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, try to find signs of issues with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can show your home may not have sufficient ventilation consist of wetness condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or smelly air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items end up being moldy. To spot smells in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are visible.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, ceiling, wall, and flooring coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold growth and should be discarded. Sometimes there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in surprise or seldom accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, chances exist will be mold growing nearby. Fix the moisture issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely tidy the location using established health department suggestions.<p>
