<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water.

The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>For example, impurities may collect within the air diffusers and grills, presenting contaminants into the environment. Or if the outdoor air intake is located near a source of wetness or other outdoor pollutant, it may serve as a pathway to carry the impurities inside.
