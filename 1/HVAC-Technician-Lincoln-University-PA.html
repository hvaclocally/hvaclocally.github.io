<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Heaters are like cars and trucks. As they age, you can change one part just need another part replaced or fixed next year. It doesn't take long to invest $500 just to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Heating systems incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives.

<p>Our indoor air quality experts can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center.
