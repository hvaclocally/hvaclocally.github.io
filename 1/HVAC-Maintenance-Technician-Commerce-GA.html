<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, many of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>I am very pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years ago and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
