<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
