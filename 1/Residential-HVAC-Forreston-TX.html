We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins.

<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as simply radiant systems.

When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the method is described as radiant heat.<p>
