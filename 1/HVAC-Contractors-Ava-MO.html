<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Some biological pollutants activate allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Transmittable illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing toxins. Symptoms of health issue triggered by biological toxins include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, lethargy, fever, and digestive issues.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to offer adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
