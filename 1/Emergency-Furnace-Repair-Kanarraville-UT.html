<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. However, much of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Radiant heat provides a number of distinct advantages over forced air heating systems. For example, radiant heating systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems. They do not need to fret about duct leaks, which are accountable for output losses of approximately 30% in other heating system types. Transferring heat through strong objects will likewise cause it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A home warmed by a radiant system will warm up faster, and remain warm with less energy invested. These are simply a few of the numerous benefits that a radiant heat system can provide you.<p>
