<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
