<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heat pumps work on electricity and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like a space heater) with the same quantity of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as a cars and truck radiator or typical household a/c unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>
