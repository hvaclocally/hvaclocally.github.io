<p>Elements that can contribute to the growth of biological pollutants are damp or damp building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and badly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning unit. "Humidifier fever" is a typical health problem caused by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs.
