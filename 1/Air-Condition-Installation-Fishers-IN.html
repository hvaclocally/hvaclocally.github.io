These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems.

Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
