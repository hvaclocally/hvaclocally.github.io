<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve.
