"Humidifier fever" is a typical health problem triggered by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Different fungi and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these pollutants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are family pets and household plants.<p>
<p>Utilize or open windows exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common approach of lowering exposure to indoor air toxins, also will reduce but not get rid of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.
