<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Spring Mount PA Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We chose getting something more pricey than a standard water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy costs. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Utilizing a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly lowers direct exposure to pollutants during cooking. Inappropriate modification, typically shown by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you purchase a new gas stove or range, think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot burner that burns continuously. Never ever utilize a gas range to heat your house. When the fireplace is in use, constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
