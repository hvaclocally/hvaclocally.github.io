<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
