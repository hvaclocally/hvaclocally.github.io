<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent.

He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
