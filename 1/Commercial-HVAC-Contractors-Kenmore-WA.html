<h3>Heating And Cooling Services in Kenmore WA</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>

He followed through and went the extra mile to personally pick up a required part that was not in stock, guaranteeing repairs were made so that my better half and I would not have to endure another night without heat, throughout one of the coldest winter seasons in recent memory.
