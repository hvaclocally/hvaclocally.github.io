<h3>What to Look for When Hiring an Wyandotte MI HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Don't panic! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it simply might require 24 volts of electrical power. The Nest thermostat requires 24 volts of low voltage provided by your transformer to keep the digital display on. If 24 volts isn't gotten, you'll get a blank screen. There are many different reasons your Nest appears dead or has a blank screen. We'll be discussing why you may be having difficulty with your Nest clever thermostat. Inspect your emergency breakers first. You should have the correct amount of high voltage going to your furnace. Inspect if you have the appropriate 120 volts of power going to the furnace. Often the furnace switch is unintentionally turned off by somebody going up in the attic. There is a furnace switch that in some cases goes faulty. It looks like a light switch in the attic. There are lots of wires in your furnace.<p>
