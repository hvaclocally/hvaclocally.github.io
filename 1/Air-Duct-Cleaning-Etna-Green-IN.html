<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
