<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
