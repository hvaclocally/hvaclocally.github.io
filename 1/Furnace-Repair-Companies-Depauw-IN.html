<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was sort of odd being that package was opened and products might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we fixed concerns. I would advise this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>

<p>The rest of the HVAC system likewise requires to be in top condition for the ac system to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which reside inside the home. If the private parts are in appropriate order, the technician can analyze the ductwork for signs of holes, spaces or excessive dirt. Sealing leaks in ductwork can improve HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and attend to a cooler house in the hot summer season.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to provide adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
