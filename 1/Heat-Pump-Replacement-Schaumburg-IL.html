<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity specialist at a large merchant who asked not to be named since he did not have permission to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a group that consistently keeps an eye on energy intake and temperature levels in shops to minimize costs (particularly in the evening) and to alert shop managers if temperatures in the shops fluctuate outside of an acceptable range that could avoid customers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in adequate outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
