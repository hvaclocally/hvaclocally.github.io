<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in place. Moreover, the concrete results of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one response mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided.

For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing early wear and tear, leading to holes and cracks. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.  a really advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
