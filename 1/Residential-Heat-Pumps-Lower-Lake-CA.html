<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
