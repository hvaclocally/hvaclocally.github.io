<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in efficiency advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions since they do not require any new ductwork to be set up. Because an unit is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
