Building-Related Illness (BRI) describes less frequent (however often more severe) cases of people ending up being ill after remaining in a particular building at a particular time.

<p>A SEER ranking represents Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio.

Installing a brand-new geothermal heatpump to work with an existing ground loop is far less expensive.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they utilize air to exchange heat, in the very same way as a car radiator or normal family air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outside air.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material in time.

Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
