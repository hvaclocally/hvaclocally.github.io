<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Make certain all the registers in your home are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
