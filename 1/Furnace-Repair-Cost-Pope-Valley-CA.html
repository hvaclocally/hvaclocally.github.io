<h3>Immediate Purchase HVAC Equipment at Pope Valley CA</h3>
<p>Most people are aware that outside air contamination can impact their health, however indoor air pollution can also have substantial, harmful effect. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air toxins indicate that indoor levels of pollutants might be 2 to five times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- greater than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board consistently rank indoor air contamination amongst the top five environmental health dangers to the public.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.  Secondly like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to effectively service and the unit has actually been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
