<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, however it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have a negative impact on occupants-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
