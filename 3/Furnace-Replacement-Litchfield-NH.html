<p>You're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the increase it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz.

According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher.
