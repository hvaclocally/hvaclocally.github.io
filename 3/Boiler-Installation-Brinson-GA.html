<h3>Air And Heat Repair in Brinson GA</h3>

<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not produce heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur with time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.
