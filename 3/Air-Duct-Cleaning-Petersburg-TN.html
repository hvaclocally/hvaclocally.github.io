In turn, the items in the space, like furnishings and individuals, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>

<p>The primary health result related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may position risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
