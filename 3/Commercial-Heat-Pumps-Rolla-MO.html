<p>Immediate discount rates on high-efficiency heat pump innovations are readily available to devices installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Exceptional Customer Support! Environment Pro is trustworthy and truly cared about us and our circumstance. We got back one evening to a cold house. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came by that very same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could search for and acquire it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely grateful to have a heated home once again. What's most incredible was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to assist us right prior to a vacation, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly advise this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
