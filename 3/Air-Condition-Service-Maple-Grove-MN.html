<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, however it is likewise an alternative for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, given that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are typically only available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best choice for property owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
