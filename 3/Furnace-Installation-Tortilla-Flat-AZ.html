<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s below package to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, in addition to all other types of heat pumps, have performances ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency, or COP. It's a clinical way of figuring out how much energy the system moves versus how much it uses. Many geothermal heatpump systems have Polices of 3.0 to 5.0. This suggests for every single unit of energy used to power the system, three to 5 systems are provided as heat.<p>
