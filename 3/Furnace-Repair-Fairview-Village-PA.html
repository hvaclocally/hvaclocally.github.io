<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
