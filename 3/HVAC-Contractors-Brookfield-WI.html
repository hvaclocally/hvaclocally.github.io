<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
