<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to momentarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floorings, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c unit to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers.
