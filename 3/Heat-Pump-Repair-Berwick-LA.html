<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives normally amount to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can often make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with standard equipment. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, during new building (homes generally use between one and 5 tons). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. However, new installation practices are minimizing expenses, to the point where the cost is getting closer to conventional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
