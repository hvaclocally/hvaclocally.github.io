<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product gradually.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
