<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that perfect temperature throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those common air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause costly repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get a cooling service plan which normally consists of a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
