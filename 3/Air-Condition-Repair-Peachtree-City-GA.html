<h3>Forced Air Furnace in Peachtree City Georgia</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a fast web search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was very delighted they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will absolutely be using them again.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it might suck up to twice the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to provide a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than devices installed simply a few years earlier.<p>
