<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Wayne IL</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on various home performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to help us debate which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's product and services was remarkable. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to carry out the needed electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
