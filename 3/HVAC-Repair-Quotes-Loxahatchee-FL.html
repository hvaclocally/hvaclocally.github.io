<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
