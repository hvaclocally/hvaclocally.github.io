<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
