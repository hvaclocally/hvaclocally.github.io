<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
