<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>I am very amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years ago and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
