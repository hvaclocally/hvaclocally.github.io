<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is typically essential to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such information can sometimes be obtained by requesting copies of air tracking data from the company. If keeping an eye on information is not offered, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent should request that the employer have air tracking tests conducted. Evaluation of this information may identify potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on data may not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
