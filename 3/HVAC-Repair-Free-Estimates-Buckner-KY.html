<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The most underrated HVAC part in your air conditioning system is the evaporator & condenser coil.

Most air conditioning replacements occur when the emergency ac repair Houston Heights 77007 77008 is with your coils, not your compressor. Refrigerant leaks occur when the copper or aluminum coils start to rust.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside should be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
