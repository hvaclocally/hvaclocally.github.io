<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your house that perfect temperature level throughout the year.

Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can cause costly repairs down the road.

<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts.

This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
