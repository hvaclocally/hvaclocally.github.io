<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts.

This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
