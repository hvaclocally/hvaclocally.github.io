<p>The compressor can shut and get too hot down if the condenser coils are clogged. You'll experience periodic periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them once again. Switch off the power.

<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Bessemer City NC</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
