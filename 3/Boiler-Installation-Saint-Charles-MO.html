<p>Information offered in this security guide is based upon present clinical and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The standards do not require you to alter your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services should still be readily available for your home's systems. The "life expectancy" of a central air conditioner is about 15 to twenty years. Producers usually continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts offered and honoring maintenance contracts after the brand-new standard goes into impact.<p>
<p>The first ac system and refrigerators used hazardous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
