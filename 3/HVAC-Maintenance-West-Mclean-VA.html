The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home.

Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy.
