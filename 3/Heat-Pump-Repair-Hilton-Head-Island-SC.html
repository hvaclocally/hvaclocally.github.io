<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really practical in collecting details on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and offered clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
<p>Nick B. supplied extraordinary, tailored, attentive, and quality service. His interaction design is friendly, engaging and reliable.

He followed through and went the extra mile to personally get a required part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my other half and I would not have to endure another night without heat, throughout one of the coldest winter seasons in recent memory. He also reacted to my call immediately the next morning, and coached me through a temporary repair to an issue that couldn't be resolved on the very first go to due to not available parts. I trust Nick's abilities, experience and capability to provide constant, quality service.<p>

The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
