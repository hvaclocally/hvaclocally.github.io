<h3>How to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews in Robbinsville NJ</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing trend in home construction is to minimize air leak through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, floorings, and walls. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air assists and waters down indoor pollutants exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
