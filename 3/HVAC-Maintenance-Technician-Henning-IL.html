<p>Prior to you head out and buy an air conditioning system, there are a few things to decide initially. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioning unit?

Too big and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning system and shorten its life. Too little and your air conditioning system will not have the ability to cool your house correctly.
