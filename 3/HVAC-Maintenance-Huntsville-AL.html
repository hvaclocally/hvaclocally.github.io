Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.

<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a big merchant who asked not to be called because he did not have permission to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a team that routinely monitors energy intake and temperature levels in stores to minimize expenses (especially at night) and to alert shop managers if temperatures in the stores change outside of an appropriate range that might avoid clients from shopping at the shop.<p>
