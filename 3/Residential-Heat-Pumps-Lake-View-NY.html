<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
