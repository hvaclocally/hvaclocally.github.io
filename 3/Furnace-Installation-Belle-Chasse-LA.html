An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it very rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
