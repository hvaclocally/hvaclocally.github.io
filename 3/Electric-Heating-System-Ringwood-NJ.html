<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Good AC Repair Company in Ringwood NJ</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in cars in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by qualified HVAC professionals. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of people.<p>
