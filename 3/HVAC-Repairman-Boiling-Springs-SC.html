<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern a/c) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit increase. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
