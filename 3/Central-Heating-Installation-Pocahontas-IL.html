<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the system has been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years.
