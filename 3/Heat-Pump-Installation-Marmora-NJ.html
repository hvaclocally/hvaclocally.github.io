The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash can be found in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
