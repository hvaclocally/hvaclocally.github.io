<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2.

<p>We take a look at clues before we provide guidance to replace rather than repair a heater. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater year after year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It might be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be wasting money by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>Some biological impurities activate allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Infectious illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are sent through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing contaminants.
