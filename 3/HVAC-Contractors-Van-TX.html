<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. Connection concerns along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the system. Loose, faulty or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service. Part of keeping your furnace involves examining the advised connections as well as temperature level and pressure assesses. Require time to check these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are tight and secure.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
