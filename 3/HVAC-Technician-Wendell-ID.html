Some buildings can likewise use natural ventilation by opening windows or doors.

<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A good place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation. It's kind of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there have not troubled with it!
