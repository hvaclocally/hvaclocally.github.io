<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Needs in Boston VA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really delighted that someone as experienced as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c prior to you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
