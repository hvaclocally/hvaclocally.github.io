<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
