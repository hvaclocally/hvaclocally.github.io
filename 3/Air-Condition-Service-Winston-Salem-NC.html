<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Essential Service in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which may be ranked as low as 80% effectiveness, this can suggest substantial savings in yearly heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase efficiency even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can end up being clogged with debris that can limit air flow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Unclean filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases cause the system to close down totally. By comparison, replacing a furnace and examining filter can usually be done in just a few minutes, often without any tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
