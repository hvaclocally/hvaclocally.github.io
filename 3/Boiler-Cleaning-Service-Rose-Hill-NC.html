<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, schools and homes matters, especially because we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. Ac system help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in incredibly humid climates or in cases where the air conditioning system is oversized, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the ac system will require more energy to cool your home. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace problems.

Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
