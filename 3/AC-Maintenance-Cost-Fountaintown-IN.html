<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up routinely, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can restrict airflow, potentially impacting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Unclean filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases cause the system to close down entirely. By contrast, checking and changing a furnace filter can usually be carried out in just a couple of minutes, typically with no tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
