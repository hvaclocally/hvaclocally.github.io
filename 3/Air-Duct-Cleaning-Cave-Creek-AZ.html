Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER.

<h3>Heating And Cooling Systems in Cave Creek AZ</h3>
<p>The exhaust outlets allow all hazardous gases to leave your home so there's no risky accumulation of carbon monoxide gas and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are blocked, they can result in a dangerous build-up and jeopardize your security. The technician will assess all of these elements of your system and examine the chimney flue and vent stack as well. They will look for signs of deterioration, leakages, and back draft and repair the issue throughout their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance products that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the abilities or tools needed to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the essential equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still necessary to have an expert technician check the system periodically.<p>
<p>Numerous people are becoming more aware and concerned about their health and the effect of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt consisting of contaminants and allergens can cover the cooling ductwork with time. Sometimes it should be removed to boost and refresh the quality of indoor air and enhance the cooling.

<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around fixing the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
