Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
