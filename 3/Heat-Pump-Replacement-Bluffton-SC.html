<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were terrific! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially asked for. They fulfilled my needs completely by providing a professional quote with alternatives, without pressing extra items. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The likewise promptly followed up with the essential assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without can be found in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
