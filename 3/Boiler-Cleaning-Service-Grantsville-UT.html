<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
