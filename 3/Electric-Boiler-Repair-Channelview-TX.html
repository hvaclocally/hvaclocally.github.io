<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
