<p>The toxins listed in this guide have actually been shown to cause the health impacts pointed out.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold.
