<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works but the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
