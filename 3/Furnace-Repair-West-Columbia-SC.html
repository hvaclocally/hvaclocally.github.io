<h3>The Way to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews at West Columbia SC</h3>
<p>The icing issue becomes much more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are typically set up in tandem with a more traditional form of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump throughout harsher winter season temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is utilized effectively during the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
