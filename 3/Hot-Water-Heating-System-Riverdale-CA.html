<p>Though it may be tough to believe, the air inside your home can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are well-known for lowering the air quality in your house, however there are lots of other toxins that can not just filthy up the air, but lead to other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and building products contribute to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unpredictable organic substances) from paint and even from some kinds of carpets and upholstery products can cause issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>After the system has actually been looked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
