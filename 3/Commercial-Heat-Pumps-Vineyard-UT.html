<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have built-in delay functions. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Prior to you head out and buy an a/c, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning system?

Too big and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioner and reduce its life. Too small and your a/c unit won't have the ability to cool the house properly. When going shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are just a few of the elements that you need to take into account. Each choice can and will significantly affect your system's performance, which is why you can't afford to ignore any of them.<p>
