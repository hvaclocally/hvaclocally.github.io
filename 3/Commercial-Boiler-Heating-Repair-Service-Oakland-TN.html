<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the task based only on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few reasonable ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up team was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the expected amount of time. post install evaluation results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 unit it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the service technicians thought they just didn't seem right and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
