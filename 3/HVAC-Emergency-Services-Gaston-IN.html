<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heater, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
