<p>A geothermal heater is more reliable than options, and is not impacted by any external factors, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar power relies on regular sunlight to work effectively. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a available and dependable  source of energy.<p>
