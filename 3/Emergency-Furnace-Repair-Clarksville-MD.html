<p>Aspects that can add to the growth of biological contaminants are wet or wet structure materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and inadequately maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners.

<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide should be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements used for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
