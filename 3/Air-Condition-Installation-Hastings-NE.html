<p>Dometic's commercial grade rooftop air conditioners are performance-tested to conquer uncommon or harsh roadway and weather conditions. Numerous basic systems break down after just 4 hours of severe vibration screening, while the Vigorous II is still going strong at 30 hours and more!

<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
