<p>A specialized a/c unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic a/c unit because both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the same air path. A standard a/c transfers heat energy out of the space since its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, because all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a reference later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
