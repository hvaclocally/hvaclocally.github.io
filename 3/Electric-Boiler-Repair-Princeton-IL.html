<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: Ã¢ $ " Ã A lot of furnaces have several control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heating systems, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the brand-new control board must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonÃ¢ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnÃ¢ $ t properly identified, changing a board wonÃ¢ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when set up. ItÃ¢ $ s smart to leave this repair to a professional to identify.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, people breathe out carbon dioxide, which in small amounts is not poisonous, but may end up being hazardous if high concentrations are enabled to accumulate. Bacteria or micro-organisms might likewise be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they may spread out throughout the whole office or building by ways of the ventilation system.<p>
