<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heater, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>
