<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
