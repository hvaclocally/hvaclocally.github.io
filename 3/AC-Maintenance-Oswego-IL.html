<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, houses and work environments matters, particularly because we invest most of our lives indoors. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in very damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is oversized, it might not achieve a low humidity.

<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level.

All objects in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature level after the convected heat system has actually been running for a while, consisting of people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure." Those processes include generating outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
