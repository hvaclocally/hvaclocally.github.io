<p>A specific a/c unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic a/c because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air course. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, since all components of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is really heated up, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
