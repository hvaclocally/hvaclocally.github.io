<p>I have been using them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is truthful, trusted, and affordable on rate. It's hard to find a sincere AC person and I'm glad I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
