<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Service in Jenks</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Picture 6).<p>
