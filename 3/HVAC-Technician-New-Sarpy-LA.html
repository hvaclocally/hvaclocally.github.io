If the one you're thinking about wants to figure out the ideal system for your house exclusively on experience, move on to another contractor. Though strongly influenced by where you live, numerous factors affect the size unit required, consisting of the amount of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and positioning of doors and windows; and the orientation of your home to the sun.
