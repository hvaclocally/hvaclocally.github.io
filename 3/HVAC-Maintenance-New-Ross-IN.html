<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the convected heat system has actually been running for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
