<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
