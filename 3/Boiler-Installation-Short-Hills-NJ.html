<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Short Hills NJ - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We selected getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
