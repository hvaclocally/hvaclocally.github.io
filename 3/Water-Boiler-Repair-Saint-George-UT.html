<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
