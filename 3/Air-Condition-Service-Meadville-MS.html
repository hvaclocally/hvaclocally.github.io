After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency.

Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
