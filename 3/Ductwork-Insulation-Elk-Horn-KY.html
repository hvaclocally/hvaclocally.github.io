<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

The very best central air conditioner you can buy today will use 30-50% less energy than one purchased in 1975 while delivering the exact same amount of cooling.<p>
