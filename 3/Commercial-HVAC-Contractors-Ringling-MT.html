Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions since they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be set up. Since an unit is installed in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
