<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: They were fantastic! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally asked for.

<p>Regardless of the kind of electric glowing floor heating unit, all are factory-built to remain in one piece and not cut, broken or altered.

However, assuming they are installed correctly and correctly taken care of, the possibility of them having issues is little.<p>
