<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The objective is to supply adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
