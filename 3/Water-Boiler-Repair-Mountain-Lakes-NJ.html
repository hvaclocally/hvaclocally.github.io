There have actually been uncomfortable noises. I got it repaired and examined. I am hoping that is the end of the concern. In general, it has been an excellent experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Neat operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its looks in the beginning. But then understood A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>I extremely recommend using this service. Extremely reputable very great. Took care of a part that was not covered under guarantee quick and efficient and did not need to pay a leg and an arm to get it done.
