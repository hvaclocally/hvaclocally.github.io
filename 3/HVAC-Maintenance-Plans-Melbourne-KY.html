<h3>Furnace Repair Near Me in Melbourne KY</h3>
<p>I have been using them for years for my companies, my own houses and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is honest, reputable, and sensible on cost. It's hard to discover an honest AC man and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
