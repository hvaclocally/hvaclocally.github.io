<p>Practically half of Americans use air fresheners at least once a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that regularly, our nationally representative survey discovered. Approximately 40 percent rarely or never ever clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned up or changed their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there.
