<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works however your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
