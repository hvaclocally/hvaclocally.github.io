<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>The primary reason house owners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the quantity of services offered. If the system is new and still under a producer's guarantee, the cost might not be rewarding. Any significant repairs need to be covered under the maker's warranty. Nevertheless, some makers need routine maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, human beings exhale co2, which in small amounts is not poisonous, but may end up being dangerous if high concentrations are permitted to build up. Germs or micro-organisms may also exist within the ventilation system. They may spread out throughout the whole workplace or building by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
