<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil change in your car. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter once every 3 months. Throughout high usage months, check the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
