<p>These people have been excellent. At a realtor, I often need contractors to provide me a viewpoint for what deal with a house may cost. Just recently I required to call on these guys twice. They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Stability isn't just their name, it's an organisation model they take seriously. You men are officially on speed dial. Speak with you soon.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement tries to upsell you whenever they come to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was six months prior to the existing one expired. She didn't need a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
