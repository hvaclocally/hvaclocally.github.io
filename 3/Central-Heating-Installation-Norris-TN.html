<h3>The Advantages of Buying A New Furnace in Norris TN</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We decided on getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
