<h3>Choosing Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Ewan NJ</h3>
<p>One of the primary reasons a furnace will run constantly is because something is unclean or blocked Prior to attempting to fix any issue, take some time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is good to go, inspect the furnace blower for clogging and tidy it. If this does not work, have a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it. If you still can not find out why your furnace keeps running, call a skilled technician.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
