Their techs are really knowledgeable and professional. Expenses are sensible. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser today. Due to the fact that the cost was obviously reasonable, I did not bother to get competitor's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff.<p>
<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably minimizes exposure to pollutants throughout cooking. Inappropriate modification, typically indicated by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you purchase a new gas stove or range, think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot burner that burns continuously. Never use a gas range to heat your home. When the fireplace is in use, constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
