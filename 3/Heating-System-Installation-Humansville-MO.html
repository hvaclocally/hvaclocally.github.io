They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, since it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
