<p>Specific immediate effects resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically tough to identify if the symptoms are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is essential to pay attention to the time and location the symptoms take place. If the symptoms fade or go away when an individual is far from the home and return when the individual returns, an effort must be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some results might be intensified by an insufficient supply of outdoor air or from the heating, cooling, or humidity conditions common in the house.<p>
<p>Whatever heating system you set up, it's important that it's sized correctly for your home. Too big and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should. Plus, it will use excessive energy for the amount of heat you want produced. If the system is too little, then your house won't be warmed properly and the system will need to continuously run to try to heat the whole home, which will increase heating costs.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
