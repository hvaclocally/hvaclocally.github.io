<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
