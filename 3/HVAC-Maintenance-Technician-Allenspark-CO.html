<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller home, which will affect installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were preferred in the first half of the 20th century, specifically in commercial structures, apartment buildings and very large homes. Lots of steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, because the lack of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to use and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>
