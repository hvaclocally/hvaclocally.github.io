It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I seem like they offer me favoritism, and am willing to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
