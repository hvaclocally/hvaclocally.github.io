<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All objects in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the radiant heat system has been running for a while, consisting of individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is arranging floor waxing and removing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This permits products to off-gas over the weekend while most of the staff are at house over the weekend. Location control includes moving the toxin source away from residents or even transferring susceptible occupants.<p>
<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers utilized various methodologies. The CMHC study gotten in touch with numerous duct-cleaning services. The companies were not warned they were part of a study, and the scientists did not control for time spent or techniques used. The EPA study prescribed and managed techniques utilized on a smaller sized number of homes. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both studies have defects, no other research study has challenged the findings. And although the devices and approaches used by duct-cleaning companies have changed considering that these research studies were performed, the air ducts in homes haven't.<p>
<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.

<p>Many commercial structures utilize mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that are part of the heating and HVAC systems.
