<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
