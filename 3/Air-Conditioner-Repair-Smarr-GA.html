<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
