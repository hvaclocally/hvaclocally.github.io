<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Since it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize system does not lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
