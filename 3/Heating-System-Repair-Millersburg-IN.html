<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. When the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly harden and treat-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
