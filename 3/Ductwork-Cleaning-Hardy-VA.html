<p>A geothermal heating unit is more reliable than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external factors, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar energy. For example, wind energy can only be utilized when there is wind, while solar power relies on regular sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and trusted  source of energy.<p>
