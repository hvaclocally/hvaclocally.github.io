<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol result, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may get in neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
