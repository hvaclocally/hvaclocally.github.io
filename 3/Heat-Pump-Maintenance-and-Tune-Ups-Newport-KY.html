<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps men working. When a sales guy concerns your home he is there to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and need to not "need" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.
