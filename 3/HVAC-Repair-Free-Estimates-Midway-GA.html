Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating units-- although ceiling radiators are almost always utilized in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>

Ilan always makes himself available - whether it's a heating problem in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is competent with these gadgets). I have nothing but fantastic things to state - he has actually taken great care of my heating and AC needs. Quick action - quick resolution.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time repairing the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
