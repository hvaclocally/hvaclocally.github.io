<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate great however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
