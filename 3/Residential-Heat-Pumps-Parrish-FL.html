<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
