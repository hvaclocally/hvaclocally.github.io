<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Tuckahoe NJ</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
