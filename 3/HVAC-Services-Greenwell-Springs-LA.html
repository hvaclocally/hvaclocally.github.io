<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight versus the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have respiratory issues, winter can exacerbate issues.

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
