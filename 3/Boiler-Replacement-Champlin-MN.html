<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, a number of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>When attempting to figure out how often I should replace my air conditioning filters, there are numerous things to take into factor to consider. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has a special DNA on how it builds up dust and dirt.

After that, you can make a better ideal choice on how frequently your HVAC filters need replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less frequently you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with only one air conditioning filter need replacing more often.<p>
