<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 need to be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements.
