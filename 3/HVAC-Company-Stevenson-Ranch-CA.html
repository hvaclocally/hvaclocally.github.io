<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor system as near the house as possible per my demand.

Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
