<p>Air conditioning unit manufacturers normally make rugged, high quality products. If your air conditioning system stops working, begin by examining any fuses or circuit breakers. Let the unit cool down for about five minutes prior to resetting any breakers.

This means that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
