<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business several years back and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater, consider potential effects of indoor air contamination. Follow the producer's directions, especially instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit properly changed. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is typically a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heater is in use, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>
