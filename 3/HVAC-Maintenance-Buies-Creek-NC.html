<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.. Secondly like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the unit has been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
