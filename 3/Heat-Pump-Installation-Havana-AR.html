<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>Around The Clock Cooling is as promised: offered instantly to offer outstanding service. Ilan Cohavi, the owner, works nicely and efficiently to deliver a completed job in record time.

She didn't need a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
