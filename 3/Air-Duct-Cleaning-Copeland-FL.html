<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it becomes wet.<p>
