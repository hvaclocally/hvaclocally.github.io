<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Due to the fact that it simply takes more electricity to run a larger unit, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize system does not lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
