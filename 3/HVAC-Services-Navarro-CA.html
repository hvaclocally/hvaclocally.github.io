<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, germs, and extremely little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to evaluate and, if essential, update the building envelope. For example, he may seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation might be a more reliable solution to your cooling issues than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems.
