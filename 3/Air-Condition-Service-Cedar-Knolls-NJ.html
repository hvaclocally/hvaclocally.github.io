<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
