<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
