Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan need to spin. If the compressor begins but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut down the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover.
