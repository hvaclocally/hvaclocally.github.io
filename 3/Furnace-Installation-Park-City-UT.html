<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a service was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners should pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the very same in all other areas.<p>
