For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early deterioration, resulting in cracks and holes. , if that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.. a really beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
