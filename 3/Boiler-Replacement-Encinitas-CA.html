<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to supply adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
