<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside your home and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
