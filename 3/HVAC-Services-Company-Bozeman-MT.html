<p>5. Odor excellent naturally. You may associate that lemony or piney aroma with a clean kitchen or tidy artificial fragrances in laundry products and air fresheners give off dozens of various chemicals into the air.

<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more tough to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by people and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
