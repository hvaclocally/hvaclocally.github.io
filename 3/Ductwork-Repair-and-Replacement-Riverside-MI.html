<p>Buildings are developed or planned to respond actively to some of these changes around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sanitize, and keep surface areas to boost their performance, appearance, or durability. In other cases, such modifications subtly and even dramatically alter buildings in ways that may be essential to their own integrity or their influence on structure residents through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them until they have actually been correctly dried. Attempt a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>

<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heater, think about possible results of indoor air pollution.
