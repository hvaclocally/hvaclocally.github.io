<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young kids can be extreme. They consist of hold-ups in psychological and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, babies, and children are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults since lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the destructive results of lead. Kids may have higher exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
