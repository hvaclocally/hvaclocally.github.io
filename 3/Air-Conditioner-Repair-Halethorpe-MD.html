<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it might flatter two times the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's because it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed just a couple of years earlier.<p>

<h3>How to Select An Expert HVAC Tech in Halethorpe MD</h3>
<p>Our group is led by the two Gamst brothers who both started working on air conditioning system with their daddy John Gamst after school and on weekends. Whether it's servicing, repair, air, or furnace conditioning installation, neither one remembers finding out the trade it just came naturally. A foundation like that and a passion to do the best thing is what makes our company what it is today. A Leading Technological HVAC thought leader and the only place to get a 5 year part warranty with repairs.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
