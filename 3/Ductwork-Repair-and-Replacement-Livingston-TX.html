<h3>Immediate Purchase HVAC Equipment at Livingston TX</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my companies, my own houses and my realty clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control.
