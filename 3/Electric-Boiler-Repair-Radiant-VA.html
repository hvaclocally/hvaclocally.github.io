I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
