<h3>Furnace Repair Cost in San Pedro CA</h3>
<p>One of the downsides of central heating is that it's possibly pricey to install, especially in an older house. Depending on the kind of unit set up, it can be noisy and trigger problems if you're extremely allergic to dust. In addition, particular fuels and equipment might need unique permits, and there is minimal flexibility in the event of altered heating requirements. During use, there is a dead time while heat is being transported from the heating system to the home.<p>
<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently higher wages for air conditioning tradesmen. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or simply a high level of competitors for experienced trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's greatest average earnings for HVAC technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually. Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the 5 highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 per year.<p>
<p>Annual furnace maintenance is the best method to keep your heater working safely and efficiently.
