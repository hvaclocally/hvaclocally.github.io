<p>There are 2 main kinds of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's known in the house heating service. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the floor surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are forced to withstand existing, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are prone to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot beside the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat offers heat from the flooring up throughout the room with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
