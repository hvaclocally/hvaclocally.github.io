<p>Measurement procedures are being developed and demonstrated to examine building ventilation and indoor contaminant concentrations. These procedures vary from advanced tracer gas approaches utilized primarily in building research efforts to less involved procedures that can be used by constructing operators.

<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators.

<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
