<p>We recommend using our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs.

They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to heat up the concrete piece listed below.

<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
