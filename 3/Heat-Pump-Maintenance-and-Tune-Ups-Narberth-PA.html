<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>The primary reason homeowners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the quantity of services offered. If the system is new and still under a manufacturer's guarantee, the cost may not be rewarding. Any major repairs should be covered under the maker's service warranty. However, some producers need regular maintenance as a regard to the guarantee.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
