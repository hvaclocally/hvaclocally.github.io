<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to offer adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this.

The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
