<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Knowing the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Saint Francis KY</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics lately, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular assessments. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which requires to be correctly vented and cleaned up from the furnace routinely. Change the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned up because the soot develops inside the ducts, reducing their efficiency with time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
