<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
