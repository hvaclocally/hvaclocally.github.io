<p>Correct ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same contaminants. In other words, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also exacerbate indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system may be infected (since of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for instance), and the system may spread these contaminants throughout the home. Second, the HVAC duct distribution system can spread out contaminants from one part of the house to another. Regular maintenance and duct sealing can help decrease these problems.<p>

All bids (get at least three, from accredited, well-regarded companies) must include this one-page printout.<p>
<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the condenser, compressor, and evaporator are all situated in one cabinet, which usually is placed on a roofing or on a concrete slab beside your house's structure. This type of a/c also is utilized in small commercial structures. Air supply and return ducts originate from indoors through the house's outside wall or roofing system to get in touch with the packaged air conditioning system, which is usually situated outdoors. Packaged air conditioning unit often consist of electric heating coils or a natural gas furnace. This mix of a/c and central heating system eliminates the requirement for a separate furnace indoors.<p>
<p>Outside impurities. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and irritants discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Specialists advise utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and typically are more appropriate for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
