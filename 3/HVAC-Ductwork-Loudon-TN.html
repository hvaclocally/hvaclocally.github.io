<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

Itâ $ s just best.<p>
