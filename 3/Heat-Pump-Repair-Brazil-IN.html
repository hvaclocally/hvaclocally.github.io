<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power needs to not surpass the capability of the outdoor system.

Basically, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that a few of the spaces may not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the estimation of the total power is not easy, since it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
