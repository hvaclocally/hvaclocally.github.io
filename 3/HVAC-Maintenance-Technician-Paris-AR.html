<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
