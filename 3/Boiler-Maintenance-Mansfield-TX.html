<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Mansfield TX</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We decided on getting something more costly than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it extremely rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
