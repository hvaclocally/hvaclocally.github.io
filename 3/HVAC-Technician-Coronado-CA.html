<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down totally. By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can generally be performed in just a couple of minutes, often without any tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

With split system units, the majority of the parts are housed in a metal box beyond the home. However, there are some internal parts as well. Split systems are perfect for cooling multiple spaces simultaneously, but are not extremely energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the home.
