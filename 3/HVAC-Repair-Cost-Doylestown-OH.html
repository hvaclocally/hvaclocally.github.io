<p>A geothermal heating unit does not create its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as gas, oil, or coal. Rather, it soaks up heat from within the earth.

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
