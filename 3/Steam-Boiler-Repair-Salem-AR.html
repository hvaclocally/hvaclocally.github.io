<p>Indoor air pollution originates from a range of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually recognized structure products, home furnishings, and mold as severe issues, but much of the danger likewise comes from burning things. For example, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop contamination in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly big concern in the developing world.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also may add to indoor air quality problems.
