<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
