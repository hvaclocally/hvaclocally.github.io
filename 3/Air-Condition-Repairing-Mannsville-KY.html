<h3>Everything You Will Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair in Mannsville KY</h3>

After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<h3>Central Air Conditioner Installation in Mannsville KY</h3>
<p>Central air units are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour.

ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless hazardous gas. Because it is difficult to see, taste or smell, CO can kill you before you know it remains in your home.

The results of CO direct exposure can differ significantly from person to individual depending on age, general health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
