<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>The steadiness of the industry's growth does not always translate to the experience of running an HVAC company. The ventilation, air and heating conditioning business tends to run cold and hot. When consumers need their HVAC systems fixed for relief versus the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather condition shows up, demand heats up during the summer season and winter.<p>
