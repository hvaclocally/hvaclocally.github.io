<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
