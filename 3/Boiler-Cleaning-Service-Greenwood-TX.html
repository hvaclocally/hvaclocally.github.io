<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide must be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
