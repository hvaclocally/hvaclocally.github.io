<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters houses through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains, and sumps. When radon becomes trapped in structures and concentrations develop inside your home, exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>

<p>These principles-- and desire to suffer through the heat-- may already be altering. Though only 33 percent of Seattle real estate systems had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 new housing units have actually been built in the four years since or are currently under building and construction. The large majority of these units are multi-family or mixed-use, where a/c is more of an industry requirement, says Scott Vollmoeller of engineering firm Glumac.<p>
<p>There is a required balance in making your decision though as systems with higher AFUE rankings often come with higher price tags. So, make certain to decide based on how often you will utilize your heating system, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year. For many temperate climates with low heating loads in the winter season, having an incredibly high rated heating unit is not always required.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a referral later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
