I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the new part.

He was at my home within the time he gave me, repaired the problem while describing the issue then stayed several minutes to make sure it was working appropriately. The problem was fixed in a matter of time that I have actually never seen prior to while being a house owner for 10 years. I likewise advise among the Protection Plans, which I am a member of, if you like to conserve money. Thank you." Karen P.<p>
