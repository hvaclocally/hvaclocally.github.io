<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen with time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.
