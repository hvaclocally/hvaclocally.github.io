From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some basic maintenance.

<p>Central air is a high-end not everyone can afford, so many Seattleites should find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle might be the last city in the country to deal with the reality of a harsh, terrible summer.<p>
<p>When it comes to heated water or steam, piping is used to carry the heat to the spaces. A lot of modern warm water boiler heater have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the distribution system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air using radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be mounted on walls or installed within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
