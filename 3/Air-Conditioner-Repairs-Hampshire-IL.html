<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
