<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

Also they diagnosed the problem and fixed very rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
