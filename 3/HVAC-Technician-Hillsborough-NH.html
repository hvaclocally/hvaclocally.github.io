<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years approximately. Unscrew the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Photo 6).<p>

<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a company was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't completion objective. HVAC entrepreneur need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps men working. When a sales guy comes to your house he exists to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and need to not "require" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I offer you the alternatives for your needs and you decide if you require it.<p>
