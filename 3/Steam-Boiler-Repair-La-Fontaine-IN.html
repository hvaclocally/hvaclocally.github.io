<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioners and refrigerators utilized toxic or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
