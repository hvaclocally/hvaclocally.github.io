<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
