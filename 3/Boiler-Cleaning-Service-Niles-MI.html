All the damp hot air that passes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then gotten rid of from the space that is being cooled. If your HVAC system is not draining properly, you'll have a water leak. A constraint in your drainage pipes triggers a water leakage. There are several locations an obstruction can take place. One of the primary locations where obstructions begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
