<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level.

<p>With the cost of electricity and gas increasing, it is essential to have your furnace tuned-up for maximum energy savings. This will keep you from needlessly paying more than you should. Paragon Heating & House Convenience Solutions Combustion Optimization & Security Assessment of your furnace includes an Efficiency Check-Up, in which the thermostat is looked for accuracy and the burners are changed for maximum efficiency. Paragon Heating & Home Convenience Solutions DOES NOT use the useless 'eyeball the flame' technique that other companies utilize. Instead, the combustion is optimized by determining the exhaust gasses and making clinical modifications. This alone might pay for the entire maintenance see at today's price of gas.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
