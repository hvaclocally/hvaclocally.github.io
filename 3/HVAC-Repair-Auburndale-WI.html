<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
