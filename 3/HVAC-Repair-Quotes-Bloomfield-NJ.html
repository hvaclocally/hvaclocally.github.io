<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Brian was every bit honest, enjoyable and responsive.

<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more challenging to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>The predominant health impact associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
