<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
