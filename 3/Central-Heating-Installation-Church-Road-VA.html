<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
