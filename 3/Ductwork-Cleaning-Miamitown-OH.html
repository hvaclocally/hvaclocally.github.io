<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
