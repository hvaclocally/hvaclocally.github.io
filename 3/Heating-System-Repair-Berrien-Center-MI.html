On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having resolved the problem with a simple repair he did on-site, not replacing the entire part. He got along, uncomplicated and a completely satisfying person to have around that entire time. His time and know-how to SOLVE the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a somewhat unsure diagnostic.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
