<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats.

Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
