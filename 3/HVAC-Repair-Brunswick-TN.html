<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
