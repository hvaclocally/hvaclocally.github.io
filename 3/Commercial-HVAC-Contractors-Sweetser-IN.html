<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>
