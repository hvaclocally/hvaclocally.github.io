<p>Buildings are designed or meant to respond actively to some of these modifications in and around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and maintain surface areas to improve their look, longevity, or efficiency. In other cases, such modifications discreetly or perhaps dramatically modify buildings in ways that might be important to their own stability or their influence on structure residents through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time.
