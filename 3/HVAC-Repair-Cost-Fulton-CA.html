<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
