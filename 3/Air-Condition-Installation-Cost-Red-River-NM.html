<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming indoors. Most home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors remove pollutants straight from the space where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Open windows or utilize exhaust fans. Ventilation, a typical approach of lowering direct exposure to indoor air pollutants, also will lower but not eliminate exposure to ecological tobacco smoke.

In addition, the big boosts in ventilation it takes to considerably lower direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs substantially. Consequently, the most effective method to decrease direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to remove cigarette smoking there.<p>
