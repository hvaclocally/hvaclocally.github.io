<h3>Furnace Repair Companies in North Houston Texas</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Dripping return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
