<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Ensure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
