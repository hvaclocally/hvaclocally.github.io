Incorrectly located outside air consumption vents can also generate air infected with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning system, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>
