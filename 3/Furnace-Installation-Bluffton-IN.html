<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
