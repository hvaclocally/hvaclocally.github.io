<h3>Heating Systems in Commiskey Indiana</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>Another option to oil furnaces are gas heaters While oil is typically used in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have an option between the 2 types.
