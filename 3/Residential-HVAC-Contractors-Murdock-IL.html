<p>A specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioning system because both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the very same air course. A basic a/c unit transfers heat out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all parts of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is actually heated up, just as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
