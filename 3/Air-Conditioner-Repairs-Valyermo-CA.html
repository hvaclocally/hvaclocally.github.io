<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.
