Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
