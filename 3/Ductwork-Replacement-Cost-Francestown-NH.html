<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
