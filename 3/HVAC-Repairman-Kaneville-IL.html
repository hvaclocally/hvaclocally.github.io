This type of air conditioning system also is utilized in small commercial structures. Air supply and return ducts originate from inside through the home's outside wall or roof to get in touch with the packaged air conditioning unit, which is usually situated outdoors. Packaged air conditioners often include electric heating coils or a gas furnace. This mix of ac system and central heating system gets rid of the need for a different furnace inside.<p>
<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have two different units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room a/c supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air.<p>
