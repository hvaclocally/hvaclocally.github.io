<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
