<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
