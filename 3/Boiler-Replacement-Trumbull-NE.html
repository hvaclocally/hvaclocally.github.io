<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make sure all the registers in the house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>
