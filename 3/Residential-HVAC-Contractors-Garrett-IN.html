<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
