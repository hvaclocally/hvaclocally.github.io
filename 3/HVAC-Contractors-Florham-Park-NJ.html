<p>New air conditioners typically vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER score implies higher energy performance and possibly lower energy bills.

<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the compressor, evaporator, and condenser are all located in one cabinet, which normally is placed on a roof or on a concrete piece next to the house's foundation.

<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your air conditioning system and heatpump need to be devoid of all obstructions and debris. Clogs can obstruct the flow of condensed water and cause wetness accumulation within the system. Excess moisture can trigger problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the home, irregular temperature level guideline, germs, and jeopardized air quality. A professional maintenance technician will clean the condensate and flush drain to ensure all excess wetness flows far from the system.<p>
