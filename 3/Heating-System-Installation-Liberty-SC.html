<p>The function of a lot of building ventilation systems is to bring in adequate fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing safety at affordable energy expenses. Load calculating is described as the Manual J estimation and ought to be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or system cost for cooling. If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based upon experience or on square video alone, move to another contractor.
