<p>Typically the most reliable way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-effective method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later in this area.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and people; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
