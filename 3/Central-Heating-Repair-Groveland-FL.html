<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil.
