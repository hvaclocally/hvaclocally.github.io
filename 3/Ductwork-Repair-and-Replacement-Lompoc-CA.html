<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing product acquired with the house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and plumbing.

As a new property owner I have actually found out how to recognize the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
