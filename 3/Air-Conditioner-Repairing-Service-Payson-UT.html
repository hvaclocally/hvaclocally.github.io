Older systems from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably simple procedure. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive.<p>
