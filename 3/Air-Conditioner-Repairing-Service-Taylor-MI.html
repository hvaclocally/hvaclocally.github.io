<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
