<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as near your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Rockford OH?</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater need fairly little attention. However, as with any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is vital to keep the system working smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of conventional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank must be looked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed occasionally to eliminate tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in tough water areas). The systems must be inspected at least two times each year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to eliminate dust gathered in order to improve collector efficiency.<p>
<p>There are several variables that contribute to indoor air contamination. Such aspects include the use of chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide given off by cigarette smoke and outdoors traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls included in electrical transformers; radiation from constructing insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents utilized in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
