<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location.

When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, however a house owner does not have the abilities or tools essential to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and correct air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still required to have an expert technician check the system periodically.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you may want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities. You might look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capacity and efficiency if you currently have a home heating system. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one major drawback of heat pumps is that they can fail in the cold or very hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
