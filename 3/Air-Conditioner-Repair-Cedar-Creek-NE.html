These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
