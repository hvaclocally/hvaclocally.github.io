<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been properly dried. If items with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to provide sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
