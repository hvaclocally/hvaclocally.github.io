<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems need relatively little attention. But, as with any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is essential to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of standard hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank need to be looked for leaks, the system needs to be flushed regularly to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in hard water areas). The systems ought to be inspected a minimum of twice per year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed occasionally to remove dust gathered in order to improve collector performance.<p>
<p>When all the tasks have been completed, the last task is to test the system to ensure it cools effectively. HVAC systems are operated through the thermostat. This last check might point out faults in the thermostat, which may be as basic as a requirement to replace batteries. A failure to switch on may simply include a tripped breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician talks about any problems or issues and makes suggestions about upgrades where suitable.<p>
