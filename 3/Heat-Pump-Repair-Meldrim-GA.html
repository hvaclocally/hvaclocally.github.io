<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Meldrim GA?</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math lately, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the patio where the unit sits. I feel like they offer me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
