<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to look out for is the dust that gathers throughout summer seasons. The best thing to do is ensuring that the heating unit burners are inspected and cleaned up completely prior to cooler seasons begin.

If your furnace is in an extremely bad condition, perhaps it is time to start considering buying a brand-new one.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning system and refrigerators employed flammable or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

The Department of Energy's Energy Performance and Renewable Energy section recommends that "Air Purification need to have a Minimum Performance Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to lower the amount of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can act as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can decrease the performance of the coils.<p>
<p>There are some more major dangers for HVAC workers that could be possibly deadly. They can be exposed to Carbon Monoxide which can be poisonous.
