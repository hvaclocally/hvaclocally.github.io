<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Service in Drury</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside system as near your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
