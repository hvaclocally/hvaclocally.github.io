<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities. You might look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capacity and performance if you already have a home heating system. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to try to find a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
