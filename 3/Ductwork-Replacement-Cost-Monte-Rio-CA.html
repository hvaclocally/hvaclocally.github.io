<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner at Monte Rio CA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

No extra charge.<p>
