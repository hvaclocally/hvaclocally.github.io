<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump While space a/c offers maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>

The size of the system determines the labor hours included to construct the system. When you think about installation costs upwards of $50 per hour, to outfit a house with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand new furnace or more.<p>
