<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often described as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating elements set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they utilize air to exchange heat, in the same method as a cars and truck radiator or typical home ac system does.
