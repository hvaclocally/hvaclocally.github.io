<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
