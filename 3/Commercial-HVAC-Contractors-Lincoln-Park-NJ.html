<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Lincoln Park NJ</h3>
<p>Sean was very valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
