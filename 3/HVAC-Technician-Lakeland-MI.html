<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
