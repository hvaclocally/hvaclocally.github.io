I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to 2 days might end up being a source for mold development and must be discarded. Often there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in concealed or hardly ever accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, opportunities exist will be mold growing nearby. Fix the moisture problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely clean the location using established health department recommendations.<p>
