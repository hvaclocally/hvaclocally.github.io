<h3>Maximizing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System at Yorkville CA</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
