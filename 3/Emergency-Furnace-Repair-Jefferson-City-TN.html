<h3>Air Conditioner Parts in Jefferson City Tennessee</h3>
<p>You're most likely hearing the fan motor attempting to start without the boost it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can usually conclude that the capacitor has failed. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille.

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
