<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated hold-up features when they're shut down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, considering that it is secured inside. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ may see musty or unpleasant odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems.
