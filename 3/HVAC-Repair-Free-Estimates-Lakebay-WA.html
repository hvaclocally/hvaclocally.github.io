<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your air conditioning unit is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Just adding refrigerant is not an option if it leaks. An experienced technician needs to fix any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the correct quantity of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and effectiveness of your ac system is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the maker's spec, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can likewise be harmful to the environment.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
