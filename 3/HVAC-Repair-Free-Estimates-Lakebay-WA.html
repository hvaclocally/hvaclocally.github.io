<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have.
