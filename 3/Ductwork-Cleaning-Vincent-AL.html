We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. In other words, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>Air ducts are responsible for dispersing cold and hot air throughout your home, offering a comfy environment in every space. However ducts that are not installed appropriately or kept can distribute impurities from one space to another. Over time, dust, dander and even mold can accumulate in your ducts, reducing the total air quality. Work with a professional to make certain your ducts are circulating fresh, tidy air.<p>
