<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
