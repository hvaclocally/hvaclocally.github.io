<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
