<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
