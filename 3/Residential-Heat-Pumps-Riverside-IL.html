<h3>How Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Riverside IL Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes far more severe with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heat pumps are frequently installed in tandem with a more standard type of heating, such as an electrical heater, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump throughout harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heatpump is utilized efficiently throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
