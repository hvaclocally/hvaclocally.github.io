<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service in Somerdale NJ</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in home building and construction is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings in floors, roofs, and walls. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
