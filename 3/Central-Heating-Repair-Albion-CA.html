<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Excellent Product! Delivery was kind of odd being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to use. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we resolved issues. I would recommend this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>We have been exceptionally pleased with Stability's devices (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten finished yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heat pump has actually worked extremely well and is so effective that it considerably minimized our utility expenses - the system will pay for itself in less than 5 years. The few times we have needed them for emergencies they reacted quickly and fixed the issue.<p>
