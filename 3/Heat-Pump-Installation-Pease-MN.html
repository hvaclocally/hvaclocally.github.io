<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2.

<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently greater incomes for air conditioning tradesmen.

The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.
