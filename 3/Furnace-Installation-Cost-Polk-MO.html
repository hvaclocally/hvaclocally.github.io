<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
