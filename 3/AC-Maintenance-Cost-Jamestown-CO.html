The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
