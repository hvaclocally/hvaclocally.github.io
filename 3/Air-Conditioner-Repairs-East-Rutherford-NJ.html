<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
