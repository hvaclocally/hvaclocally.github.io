After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In many cases, determined particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

Pollutants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in a connected garage, backyard trash burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground below. An air toxin might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care items. Germs and viruses, family pet dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
