<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
