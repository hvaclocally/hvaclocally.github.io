That's where ductless ACs come in! Also called mini splits" or split level ACs," ductless Air conditioners can be installed in your house without all the pesky ductwork that comes with traditional HVAC systems.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
