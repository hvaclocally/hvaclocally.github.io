Load calculating is described as the Manual J estimation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or unit cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square footage alone. Similar to determining the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, figuring out the proper size of system for your house likewise depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

<p>1. Central Air Conditioning Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a moderate environment, where the temperature doesn't get too low or too high. To put it simply, they are ideal for our Seattle environment! They are highly efficient, beating out most other types of heater in effectiveness.

However, a geothermal installation usually costs 10s of thousands more than an air source heatpump, which generally means it fails in terms of return on investment.<p>
