<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
