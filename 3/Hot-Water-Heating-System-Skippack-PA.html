<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
