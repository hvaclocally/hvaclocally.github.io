<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
