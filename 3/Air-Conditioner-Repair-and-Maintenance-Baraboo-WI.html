<h3>Central Heating Installation Service in Baraboo WI</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We chose getting something more pricey than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our most significant energy expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
