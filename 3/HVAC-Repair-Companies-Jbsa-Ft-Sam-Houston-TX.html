<p>Information provided in this security guide is based on present clinical and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The standards do not need you to alter your existing central air systems, and replacement parts and services must still be available for your home's systems.

Manufacturers generally continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance contracts after the new standard goes into result.<p>
