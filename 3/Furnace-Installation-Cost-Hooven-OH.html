<p>There is no easy response, however many utilize the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better option. If the current system has not sustained other major repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and issues that caused the breakdown can be recognized and fixed, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense also.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may pick to change the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system. Seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the brand-new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor unit if you do so. Nevertheless, thinking about current modifications in refrigerants and a/c designs, it may be smarter to change the entire system.<p>
