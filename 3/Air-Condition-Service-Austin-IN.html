Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits.

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a referral later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
