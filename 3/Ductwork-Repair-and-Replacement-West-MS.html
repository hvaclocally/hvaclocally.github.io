<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
