In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads.
