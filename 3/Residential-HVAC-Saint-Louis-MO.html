<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
