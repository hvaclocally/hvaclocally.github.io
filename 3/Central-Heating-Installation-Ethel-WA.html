<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air.

Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
