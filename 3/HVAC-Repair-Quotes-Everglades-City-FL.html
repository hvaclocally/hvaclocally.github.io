<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
