<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
