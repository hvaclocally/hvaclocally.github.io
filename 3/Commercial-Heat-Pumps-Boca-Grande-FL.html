Although temperature levels are frequently in the comfort variety, some professional procedures, such as open heart surgical treatment, need low temperature levels (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, relatively high temperatures (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F).

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode".

This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
