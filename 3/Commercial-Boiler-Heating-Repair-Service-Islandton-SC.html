<h3>HVAC Cleaning in Islandton South Carolina</h3>
<p>Using air filters can trap some of the air toxins. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy section recommends that "Air Filtering must have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as identified by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to reduce the amount of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can act as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can lower the performance of the coils.<p>
<p>Airflow patterns in structure are determined by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects. Air pressure differences developed by these forces move airborne toxins from locations of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure through any available opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the inside pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
