"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
