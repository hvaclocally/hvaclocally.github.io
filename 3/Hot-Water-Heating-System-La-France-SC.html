<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a cars and truck radiator or typical household air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outside air.<p>
