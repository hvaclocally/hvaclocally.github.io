<h3>Facts All Lyman SC Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.  Second of all like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the unit has been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
