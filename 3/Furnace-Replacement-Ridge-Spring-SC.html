<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the proper temperature level. Heating systems that kick on often may be because of an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>

If your system is near, or past, its anticipated lifespan, replacement might be the most affordable solution.<p>
