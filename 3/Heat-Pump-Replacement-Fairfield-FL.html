<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Compounding the kept in mind health signs might be job stress. In part, due to various aspects of workplace automation, the most stressful components of workplace work are increasing.
