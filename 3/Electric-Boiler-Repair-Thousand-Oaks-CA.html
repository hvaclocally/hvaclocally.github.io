<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They consist of delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems.

Kids might have greater exposures given that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Thousand Oaks California</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
