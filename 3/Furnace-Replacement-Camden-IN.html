<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have a problem as long as your home still warms to the best temperature level. The temperature of the air produced by the heatpump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel really hot. If your home is not heating up, only be concerned. However, if your system does not seem working correctly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you need to hire a specialist to inspect and repair the unit.<p>

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough task that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps men working. When a sales male pertains to your house he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and should not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on.
