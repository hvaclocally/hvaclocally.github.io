<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
