<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy efficient methods of heating or cooling a house. Relying on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be heated in cooler months by transferring and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures discovered just a few feet below ground. In the summer months, the process reverses, therefore cooling a home by getting rid of heat. Underground temperature level stays continuous no matter the climate, so geothermal systems supply constant and dependable heating & cooling.<p>
<p>The most harmful asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After they are breathed in, they can stay and accumulate in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be fatal). Signs of these illness do not show up until many years after exposure started. The majority of people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to raised concentrations on the job; some developed disease from direct exposure to clothing and devices brought home from task sites.<p>

If you've tested the air in your home and found a radon problem, and you have a well, get in touch with a laboratory certified to determine radiation in water to have your water evaluated. Radon problems in water can be easily fixed. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
<p>They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my needs completely by offering a professional quote with options, without pushing additional products. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also quickly followed up with the necessary examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Typically the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more affordable technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
