<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
