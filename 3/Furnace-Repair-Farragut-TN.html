<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating devices can last for many years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel bills all of a sudden seem greater than normal, it is most likely time to consider a brand-new system. New heating equipment is much more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel costs right away, not to point out the money you'll save on repair costs. You can probably expect to cut your fuel expenses in half if your heating system is 25 years old or more.<p>
<p>I have actually utilized around the clock for 5 plus years now. I have signed an annual maintenance contract which covers 2 services every year. Ilan has been fantastic through all these years. Always keeps my system serviced and tuned. Have not had any problems. Whenever he sees any concerns, he informs me about it and proactively repairs the parts. Really happy with their service. Would recommend them anytime.<p>

<p>Sean was really useful. He is a very pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
