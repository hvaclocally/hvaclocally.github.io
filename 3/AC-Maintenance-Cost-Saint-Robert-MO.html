<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash can be found in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
