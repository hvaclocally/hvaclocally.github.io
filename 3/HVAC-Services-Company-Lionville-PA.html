<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair.
