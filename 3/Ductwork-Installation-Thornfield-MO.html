In this case, the heatpump is used efficiently throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>When all the jobs have been completed, the last task is to check the system to make certain it cools successfully. HVAC systems are operated through the thermostat.
