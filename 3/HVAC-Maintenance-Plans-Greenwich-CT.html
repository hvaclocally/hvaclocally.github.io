<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.
