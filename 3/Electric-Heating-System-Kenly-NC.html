<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless hazardous gas. Due to the fact that it is difficult to see, taste or smell, CO can eliminate you before you know it remains in your house. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO triggers moderate results that are often mistaken for the influenza. These symptoms include headaches, dizziness, tiredness, queasiness and disorientation. The effects of CO exposure can vary considerably from person to individual depending upon age, total health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
