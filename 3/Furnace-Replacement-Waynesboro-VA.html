A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
