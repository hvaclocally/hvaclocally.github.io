<p>Equipment expenses are driven by the kind of furnace at the heart of your home heater. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, but lead to higher energy bills. High-efficiency designs cost more, however conserve more over the long run. Prices for gas heating systems vary from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models up to $12,500 for high-efficiency designs. Electric furnaces start at $395 and range as much as $1,700 or more depending upon the brand and furnace size.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as important when it pertains to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heater, think about possible impacts of indoor air pollution. Follow the manufacturer's directions, especially instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit correctly changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indication of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heater is in usage, open a door from the room where the heater is located to the rest of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
