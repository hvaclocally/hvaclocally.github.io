<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>The EPA advises that you have your duct examined by an expert heating and cooling contractor. If your technician finds that your duct have considerable mold, dust, dirt, and other contaminants or a musty odor, they might recommend duct cleaning This is specifically important if someone in your household has asthma, allergic reactions, or other symptoms that may be connected to indoor air pollution.<p>
