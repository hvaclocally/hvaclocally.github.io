<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner in Hansen ID</h3>
<p>If you require furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to buy it. My partner stated that she had seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow.
