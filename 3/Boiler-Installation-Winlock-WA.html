<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise controling the temperature level of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches.
