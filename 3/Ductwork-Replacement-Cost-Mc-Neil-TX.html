<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, since a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>

<p>Air conditioners can produce a great deal of water because they get rid of wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
