<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor devices through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>

<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heater, think about prospective results of indoor air pollution. Follow the producer's instructions, specifically directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit correctly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is normally an indication of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heater is in use, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the remainder of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
