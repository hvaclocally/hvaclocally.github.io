<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>There are two main types of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's known in the house heating company. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the flooring surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are forced to withstand present, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
