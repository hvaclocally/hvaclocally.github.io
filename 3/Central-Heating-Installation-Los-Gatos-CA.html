<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

This means for each unit of energy utilized to power the system, 3 to 5 units are supplied as heat.<p>

The main route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might enter close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
