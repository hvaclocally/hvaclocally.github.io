<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor system rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor system.

<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 Â° F and an indoor temp of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>3.
