<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  unit rather of ducting air directly from the outside system.

Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>There's a big difference in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical form of house heating-- convection.
