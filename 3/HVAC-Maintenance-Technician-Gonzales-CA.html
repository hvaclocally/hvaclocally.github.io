<p>Due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace.

If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly uncomplicated process. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite costly if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
