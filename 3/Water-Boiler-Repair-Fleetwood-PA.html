<p>For whole home setups, it's challenging, if nearly impossible, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing home, particularly a hydronic system. Localized glowing floor heat systems to be used in one or a number of spaces like bathrooms, kitchen areas or laundry rooms are quickly renovated with electric radiant flooring heat. This is much more economical on a smaller scale. Larger restorations like additions to a home may be suitable for a larger scale and more expensive hydronic system.<p>
<p>When mounting a wall sensor, consider the height at which they need to be placed. The majority of frequently they are mounted at height-level or slightly lower, if people mostly remain seated in that particular area. However, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate towards the floor or ceiling; depending upon what pollutant you're trying to track you'll need to place the sensing unit appropriately. For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the greatest concentrations inside buildings are generally near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>
