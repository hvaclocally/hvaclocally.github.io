<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location 2 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
