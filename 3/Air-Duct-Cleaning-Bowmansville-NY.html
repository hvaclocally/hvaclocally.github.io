<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the prospective to negatively impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungi, germs, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if needed, update the building envelope. For example, he may seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs.
