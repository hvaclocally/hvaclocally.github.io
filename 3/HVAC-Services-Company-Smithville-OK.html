<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed.

If we do decide to provide car debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
