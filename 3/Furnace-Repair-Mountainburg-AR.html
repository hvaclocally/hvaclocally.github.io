<h3>Ductwork Replacement Cost in Mountainburg Arkansas</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
