<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Appropriate ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same toxins.

Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively straightforward procedure.

Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly may end up being stopped up, reducing air flow quality, distribution, and volume.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space.

There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
