<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. As soon as the wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly harden and treat-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>The predominant health result associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
