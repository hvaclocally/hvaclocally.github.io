<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as a Vital Service in Los Angeles. Switched to using Wachoff's about a year earlier and they've been to your home for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced fairly, have actually dealt with the one repair I needed well, and are expert and constantly on-time. Have been through a few companies throughout the years and Wachoff's is definitely the very best I've had the opportunity to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has been great.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can become clogged with particles that can restrict airflow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Unclean filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down totally. By comparison, changing a furnace and inspecting filter can usually be carried out in just a couple of minutes, often with no tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
