<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your air conditioning unit is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Just adding refrigerant is not a service if it leaks. An experienced technician must repair any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant. Remember that the performance and performance of your air conditioning unit is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's spec, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
