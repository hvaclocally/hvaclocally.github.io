Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning an organisation was for financial liberty.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day.

I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
