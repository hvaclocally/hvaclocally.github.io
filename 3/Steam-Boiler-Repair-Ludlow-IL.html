<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace at Ludlow IL</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in home construction is to decrease air leakage through fractures and other openings in floors, walls, and roofs. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air helps and waters down indoor contaminants tire them from the house.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil.
