<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
