<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
