<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
