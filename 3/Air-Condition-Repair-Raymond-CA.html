<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was sort of weird being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we solved concerns. I would suggest this product to anybody who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time.
