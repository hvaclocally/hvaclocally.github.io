But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
