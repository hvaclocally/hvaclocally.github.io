<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
