<p>Check these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the issue.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If your single phase air conditioner isn't old enough to justify replacement, think about an entire home dehumidifier.

The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, improving indoor air quality and enabling higher convenience at higher temperature levels.<p>
