Some sources, such as developing products, home furnishings and items like air fresheners, can launch pollutants more or less continually.

<p>Some health results might appear quickly after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures to a contaminant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant impacts are treatable and generally short-term. In some cases the treatment is just eliminating the individual's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Not long after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins, symptoms of some illness such as asthma may show up, be worsened or aggravated.<p>
<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a difficult task that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps people working. When a sales guy comes to your home he is there to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and need to not "require" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I give you the alternatives for your needs and you decide if you require it.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not offer them.  Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
