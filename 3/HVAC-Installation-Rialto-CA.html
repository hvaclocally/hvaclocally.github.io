<p>Normally the most reliable way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-effective approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses.
