<p>For instance, problems occur when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate sufficient quantities of outdoor air.

Incorrectly located outdoor air consumption vents can also generate air polluted with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms.
