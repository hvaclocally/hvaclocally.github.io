<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you should look out for. First, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
