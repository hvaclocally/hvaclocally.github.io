<p>At Five Star Mechanical Heating and Air Conditioning, we comprehend the complex natures of the Washington school facilities throughout the Seattle, areas When choosing Industrial a/c for the instructional establishments; You should take into count the shape of the space and design of the desks.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
