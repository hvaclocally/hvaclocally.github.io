<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Wilmer AL</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they identified the problem and repaired extremely rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off contaminants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>This evaluation is for changing a 17 years of age AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who explained our options did an outstanding task in making sure we understood the benefits and drawbacks of each option. The specialists who installed the brand-new system were fast and professional, while requiring time to make certain we understood how the brand-new system worked. Overall a very first rate experience.<p>
