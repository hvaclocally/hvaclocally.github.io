<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
