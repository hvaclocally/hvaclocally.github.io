<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime air conditioning.

Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.
