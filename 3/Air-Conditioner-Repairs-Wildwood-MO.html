<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller home, which will affect installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
