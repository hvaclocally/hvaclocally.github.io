<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
