Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater.
