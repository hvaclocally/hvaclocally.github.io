HVAC professionals recommend following this basic guideline when deciding whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new.

The best central air conditioning conditioner you can buy today will use 30-50% less energy than one acquired in 1975 while providing the very same quantity of cooling.<p>
