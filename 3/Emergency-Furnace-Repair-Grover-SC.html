<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do decline them till they have actually been correctly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
