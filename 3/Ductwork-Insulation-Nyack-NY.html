<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>It may just need to be cleaned up if your central air conditioner will not cool however you can hear it running. Whether this is the cause of the problem, it's an excellent early treatment to attempt. Plan to do this on a fairly warm day. Never use a power washer for this-- it can damage the fins. The following are standards; always refer to your owner's manual. Keep in mind: Always turn off the power prior to cleaning the system.<p>
