<h3>Air Condition Repairing in Higley Arizona</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the see. They advised replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was extremely delighted they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
