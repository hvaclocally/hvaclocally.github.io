<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
