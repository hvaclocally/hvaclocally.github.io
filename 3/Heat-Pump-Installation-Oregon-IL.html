<p>There are some ranges of mold that contain hazardous substances (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible in most cases, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the launched spores.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job.

<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A good place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's type of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Building Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification.

<p>Your Evaluation This is my 3rd time utilizing Around the Clock. Ilan constantly makes himself offered - whether it's a heating issue in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is skilled with these devices). I have nothing but great things to say - he has actually taken good care of my heating and AC needs. Quick action - fast resolution.<p>
<p>As much of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in place. Moreover, the tangible results of a PM is typically difficult to measure, as one response stated the savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. The majority of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repeated usage of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature wear and tear, leading to fractures and holes. , if that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.. a really useful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
