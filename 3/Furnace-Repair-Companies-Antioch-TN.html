<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
