Lots of common building products used prior to 1975 include asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Typically, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure materials are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure remodelling. Because the fibers can be spread out into the air during the elimination process, removal of asbestos-containing materials is not constantly optimal. A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is frequently suggested instead.<p>

The greater the system's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>
