<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Issues in Clawson MI</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
