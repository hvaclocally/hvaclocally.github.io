<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Do not panic! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it just might need 24 volts of electrical power. The Nest thermostat requires 24 volts of low voltage provided by your transformer to keep the digital display on. If 24 volts isn't obtained, you'll get a blank screen. There are various reasons your Nest appears dead or has a blank screen. We'll be discussing why you might be having difficulty with your Nest wise thermostat. Inspect your emergency breakers initially. You should have the correct amount of high voltage going to your furnace. If you have the proper 120 volts of power going to the furnace, inspect. Sometimes the furnace switch is mistakenly switched off by someone increasing in the attic. There is a furnace switch that in some cases goes defective. It appears like a light switch in the attic. There are numerous wires in your furnace.<p>
