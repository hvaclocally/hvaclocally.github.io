<p>All cooling contractors need to begin their assessment of your house by performing an A/c Contractors of America Handbook J load calculation. This identifies the heat gain your home goes through. The estimation is fairly simple to carry out and will expose what size system you need. Carry on to another contractor if the one you're considering wishes to identify the best unit for your house solely on experience. Though strongly influenced by where you live, numerous factors affect the size unit needed, including the amount of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and positioning of windows and doors; and the orientation of your house to the sun. The calculation can also inform you to the possible benefits of updating the insulation in your house. By making your house more energy effective, you may be able to lower the size of the air conditioner you need.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and certifications. A great place to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Building Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Managers with BPI accreditation know that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as just one aspect (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
