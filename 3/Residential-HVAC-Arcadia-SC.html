<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
