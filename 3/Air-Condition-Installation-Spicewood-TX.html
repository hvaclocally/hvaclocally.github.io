<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature level of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>A lot of well and city water does not generally consist of lead. Water typically picks up lead inside the home from family plumbing that is made with lead materials. The only way to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested. Contact the local health department or the water provider to learn how to get the water evaluated. Send for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
<p>The primary factor property owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the quantity of services used. The cost may not be rewarding if the system is brand-new and still under a maker's service warranty. Any major repairs need to be covered under the maker's warranty. Nevertheless, some makers require regular maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
