<p>The majority of well and city water does not generally consist of lead. Water normally gets lead inside the home from home pipes that is made with lead products.

<p>Generally the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to reduce the quantity of emissions.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
