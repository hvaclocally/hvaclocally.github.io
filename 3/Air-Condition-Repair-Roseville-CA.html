<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single household houses, apartment, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large commercial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and health centers, cars such as automobiles, trains, submarines, ships and planes, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are managed with respect to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Volatile natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless hazardous gas. Because it is impossible to see, smell or taste, CO can eliminate you before you understand it is in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO triggers mild results that are often incorrect for the influenza. These symptoms consist of headaches, lightheadedness, tiredness, nausea and disorientation. The results of CO exposure can vary considerably from person to individual depending on age, overall health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
