<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
