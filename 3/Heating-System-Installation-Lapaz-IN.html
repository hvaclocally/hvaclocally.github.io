<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
