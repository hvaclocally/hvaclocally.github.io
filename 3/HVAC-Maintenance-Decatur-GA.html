Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>

<p>Equipment expenses are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your house heater. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, but result in greater energy expenses. High-efficiency designs cost more, but save more over the long haul. Prices for gas furnaces range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models approximately $12,500 for high-efficiency designs. Electric heating systems start at $395 and range up to $1,700 or more depending upon the brand and furnace size.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can vary from impurities generated from the outdoors by your animals to dangerous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air pollutant resulting from natural gas that leaves into your house without being burned off.
