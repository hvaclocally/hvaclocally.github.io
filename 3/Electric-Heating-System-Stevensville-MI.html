<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works however your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
