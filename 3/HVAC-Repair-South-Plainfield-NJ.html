<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from use. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the proper temperature level. Heating systems that kick on frequently may be due to a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
