<p>A customized air conditioning unit that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic a/c unit because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the exact same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat out of the space since its condenser coil releases heat outside. Nevertheless, because all components of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is really heated, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
