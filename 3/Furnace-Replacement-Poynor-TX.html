<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>Some health impacts might show up quickly after a single exposure or repeated exposures to a toxin. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant impacts are treatable and generally short-term.

<p>To secure family members with asthma or to reduce the possibility that someone in the home may develop asthma, the home should be examined for potential indoor asthma triggers. Each room in the house has potential asthma triggers. Some issues can be repaired rapidly, however others may need more time and work to manage or eliminate asthma triggers. Easy-to-fix issues, such as chemical odors and scents, contribute to indoor air contamination and have been known to asthma symptoms in delicate people. Other sources of indoor air pollution may be more difficult to discover. For instance, the use of space deodorizers might mask the smell of mold. If the source of moldy smells can be discovered and gotten rid of, it will enhance the indoor air quality.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ might discover unpleasant or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
