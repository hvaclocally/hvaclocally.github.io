<h3>Ductwork Cleaning in Rancho Santa Fe CA</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most cost effective if your house or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Though it might be hard to think, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are well-known for reducing the air quality in your home, but there are many other pollutants that can not just dirty up the air, but cause other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and building materials contribute to bad air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unstable organic compounds) from paint and even from some sort of carpeting and upholstery materials can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ may see moldy or unpleasant odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak with your physician about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
