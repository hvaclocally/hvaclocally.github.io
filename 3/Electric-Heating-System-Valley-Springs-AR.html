<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
