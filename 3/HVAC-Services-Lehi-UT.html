<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were terrific! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally requested. They met my needs totally by providing a professional quote with alternatives, without pushing additional items. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise quickly followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
