<p>As a VITAL SERVICES BUSINESS, we remain OPEN and available to assist with any of your pipes, drain, heating, a/c or electrical requirements. However, in the United States, as in other nations, regulative development largely stops at the doorway. This is not to state that there aren't standards for levels of CO and NO2; many bodies have set requirements and guidelines for both In the United States, the EPA, the National Institute for Occupational Security and Health (NIOSH), and the Occupational Security and Health Administration (OSHA) have set CO standards, however the EPA's guidelines only use to outdoor air. OSHA, NIOSH and others have actually set NO2 standards, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has set guidelines for both-- including for indoor air.<p>
<p>Homes can have the same indoor air problems as single-family homes due to the fact that much of the pollution sources, such as the interior building materials, home furnishings, and family products, are comparable.

<p>Particular immediate results resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently challenging to identify if the signs are a result of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this factor, it is very important to focus on the time and location the symptoms take place. If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort needs to be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts might be intensified by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the heating, cooling, or humidity conditions common in the home.<p>
<p>Speaking of air, radiant heating systems tend to improve indoor air quality. This is because forced air heater distribute air-borne impurities throughout the home during operation, provoking a range of different negative impacts. Radiant heating systems do not flow air at all, which in fact enhances your indoor air quality by restricting your direct exposure to high levels of air-borne impurities.<p>

<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
