<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a service was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner must strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>
