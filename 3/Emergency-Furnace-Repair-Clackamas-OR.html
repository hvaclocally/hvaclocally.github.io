After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance.

In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
