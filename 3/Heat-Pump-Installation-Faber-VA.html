<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best.

Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and debris in the air. When every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
