<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that ideal temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those common air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the road. So, be sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service plan which typically consists of a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Heavy manufacturing markets employ a fairly small percentage of air conditioning service technicians and other HVAC employees, but pay a few of the market's greatest earnings. Electrical power generating companies top the list, with an average wage of $34.09 per hour or $70,920 per year. Vehicle parts manufacturers, aerospace producers and car producers are all within a few cents of each other at roughly $31 per hour, or over $64,000 annually. Trains are another high-wage company, at approximately $29.33 per hour or $61,000 each year.<p>
