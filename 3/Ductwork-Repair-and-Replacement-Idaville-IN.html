<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
