I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.

<p>Next, and maybe simply as important when it comes to central air expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to correctly cool the house on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
