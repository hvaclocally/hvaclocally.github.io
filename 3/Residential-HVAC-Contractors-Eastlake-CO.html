<h3>Tips to Help You Hire Eastlake CO Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of changing or exchanging air in any space to supply high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and excessive wetness, presents outside air, keeps interior building air distributing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in autos in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be bought and utilized by certified HVAC specialists. For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by numerous individuals.<p>
