<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
