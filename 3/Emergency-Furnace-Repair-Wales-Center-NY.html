<p>You could update to the highest effectiveness gear readily available and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days.

The typical house's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician must run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring just how much air leaves the system.<p>

<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most affordable if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>We can suggest the ideal unit for your requirements if you need a brand-new heating or air conditioning unit set up. Why pay additional for a system that over- or under-performs when you can get an ideal fit? And whatever HVAC system you have, we can help keep it running strong with our preventive maintenance plans. Our techs learn more about how your system works so they can identify the subtle changes in efficiency that may be indications of bigger trouble down the roadway.<p>
