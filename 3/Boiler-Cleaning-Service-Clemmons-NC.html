<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a reference in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
