<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that ideal temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause costly repairs down the road. So, make sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service plan which usually consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
