Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
