<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
