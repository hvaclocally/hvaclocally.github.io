<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each space.
