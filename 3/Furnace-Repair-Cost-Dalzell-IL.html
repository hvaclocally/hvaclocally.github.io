<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Dalzell Illinois</h3>
<p>Making use of air filters can trap some of the air contaminants.

<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Dalzell IL</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics lately, but I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
