<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed.

Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floors, floor drains, and sumps. When radon becomes caught in concentrations and buildings build up indoors, direct exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>
