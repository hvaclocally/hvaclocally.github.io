A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>The predominant health result related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
