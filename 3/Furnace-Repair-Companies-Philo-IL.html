<p>All homes require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the right temperature. Heaters that kick on regularly may be because of an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>
<p>A SEER score stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperatures during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the very same duration.
