<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit comfortably into the window, be sure to have those dimensions on hand.

There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this.
