<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold might be living in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe in addition to the effectiveness of your heating and cooling system. There are numerous design techniques in use today; however, all ground source heat pumps operate with similar principles.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
