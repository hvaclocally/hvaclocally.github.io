<p>Check these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in the house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
