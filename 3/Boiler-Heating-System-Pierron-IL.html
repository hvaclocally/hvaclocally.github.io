<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible.

If items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can afford, many Seattleites should find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box shops like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a cruel, vicious summer season.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a building."

If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
