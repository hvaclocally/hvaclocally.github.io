<p>There are some ranges of mold that contain poisonous substances (mycotoxins). However, exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible in many cases, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the launched spores.

<p>Several efforts imagine to decrease indoor air contamination by limiting VOC emissions from products. There are guidelines in France and in Germany, and many voluntary ecolabels and ranking systems consisting of low VOC emissions criteria such as EMICODE, 19 M1, 20 Blue Angel 21 and Indoor Air Convenience 22 in Europe, along with California Standard CDPH Section 01350 23 and numerous others in the USA.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<p>Another technique to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming indoors. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, including forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window ac system with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of pollutants directly from the space where the fan is located and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
