<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Important Service in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which might be rated as low as 80% effectiveness, this can indicate substantial cost savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or greater capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often described as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>
