<p>Oil furnaces are normally not really effective. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however most do not achieve an efficiency greater than 90%. A few high-end brands have a performance of 95% by using a condenser. These are more pricey, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation as well due to the fact that a drain needs to be installed.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't emit heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place gradually since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, however it is also an option for house owners to consider.

Packaged units are great for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, considering that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capacity.
