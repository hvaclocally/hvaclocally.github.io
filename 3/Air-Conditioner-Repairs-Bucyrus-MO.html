<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the unit has been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
