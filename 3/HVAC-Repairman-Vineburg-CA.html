<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
