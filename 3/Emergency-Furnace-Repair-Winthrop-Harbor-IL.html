<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Because it just takes more electricity to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity effectively.
