If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning system you require based upon experience or on square footage alone, transfer to another contractor. Just like measuring the size of a system needed based on BTUs, figuring out the right size of system for your house also depends on the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the taken in heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
