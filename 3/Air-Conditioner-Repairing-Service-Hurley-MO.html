<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
