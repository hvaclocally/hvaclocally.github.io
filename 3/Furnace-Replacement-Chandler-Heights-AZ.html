<p>Air toxins can vary from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air pollutant arising from natural gas that escapes into your home without being burnt.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
