<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of outdoor or industrial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It may also include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to individual spaces.<p>

<p>Santa Clarita Custom Air provides free in-home consultations for new furnace setups in the Santa Clarita and San Fernando Valley. Throughout an assessment, our owner and task manager will come out to speak with you about your heating problems and choices. Then, we will stroll through your house to assess the existing system, examine your ductwork, check for dripping windows, and take measurements of each space.

<p>To be sincere, few of the centers managers who utilize our indoor air quality monitoring service came to us because of that.

It wasn't up until later, as they continued dealing with us, that they learnt more about and implemented indoor air quality keeping an eye on to provide a healthier, safer building environment-- and to avoid the unfavorable consequences related to indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>We typically set up little built-in electric space heating units when we redesign or include on a room. Unlike heat pumps, these units are self-contained. They are also safe compared to older-style electric baseboard heating units. They can be found in many different forms: wall-mounted units that are great for little spaces like restrooms, cove heaters that resemble baseboard heating systems but are tucked safely up by the ceiling, and ceiling-mounted radiant heat panels that provide a mild sunshine-like heat from above.<p>
