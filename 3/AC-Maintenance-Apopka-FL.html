These convection heating systems are still widely used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While room cooling offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is generally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
