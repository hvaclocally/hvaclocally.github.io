<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
