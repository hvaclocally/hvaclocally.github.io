<h3>Things to Search for When Selecting an Cedarville NJ HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of changing or exchanging air in any area to supply high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of unpleasant smells and excessive wetness, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior building air distributing, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
