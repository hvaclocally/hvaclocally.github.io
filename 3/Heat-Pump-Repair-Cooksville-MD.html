<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the see. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was extremely delighted they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be using them again.<p>
