The requirements do not need you to alter your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services need to still be readily available for your home's systems.

Manufacturers usually continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance contracts after the new basic goes into effect.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air conditioning system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy efficient than models made 5 years earlier, so it makes financial sense to change or update your unit if it's 5 years of ages or older.
