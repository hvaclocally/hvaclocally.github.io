<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and place of pollutant direct exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could grovel two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed simply a few years ago.<p>
