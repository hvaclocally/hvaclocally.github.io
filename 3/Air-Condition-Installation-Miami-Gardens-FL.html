<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies.

Nevertheless, a number of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
