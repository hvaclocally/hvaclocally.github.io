<p>A/c can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
