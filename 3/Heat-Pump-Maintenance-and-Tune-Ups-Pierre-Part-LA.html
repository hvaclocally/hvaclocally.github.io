<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>

<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Pierre Part LA</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
