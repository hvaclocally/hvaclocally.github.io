<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my companies, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is honest, trustworthy, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to find an honest AC man and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
