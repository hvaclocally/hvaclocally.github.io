<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with a very old name. The firm started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for years, until the required for high-efficiency units forced Goettl to end production. The contracting side of the business continued under a number of owners. Goodrich's dad was a Goettl dealership in Las Vegas, so when the opportunity came to purchase what was left of the firm in 2013, he took it.<p>

<p>Because an air conditioning unit moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
