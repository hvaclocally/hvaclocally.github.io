Soil by roads and highways may be infected from years of exhaust fumes from automobiles and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet before going into the house. Alter your clothes prior to you go home and clean these clothes independently if you work with lead in your task or a hobby. Encourage your children to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirt which sticks to toys and fingers. Try to keep your kids from eating dirt, and ensure they wash their hands when they come inside.<p>
