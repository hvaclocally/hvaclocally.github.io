<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, many of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.
