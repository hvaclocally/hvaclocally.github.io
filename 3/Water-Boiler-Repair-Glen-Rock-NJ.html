<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
