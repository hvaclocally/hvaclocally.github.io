<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based on the most current science for NO2.

<p>A vehicle's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being dirty and old. The old coolant will negatively affect the system's efficiency. To make sure the system is working successfully, consider having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your car's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>

This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large business in the field, and even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, previously this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
