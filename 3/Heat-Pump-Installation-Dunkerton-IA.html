<p>Streamline your services, earn more services earnings, and supply a fantastic customer experience. To make sure the unit you pick is the ideal size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load calculation estimate to identify the specific type of heat and a/c system that's ideal for your home-we don't simply replace it with the exact same size system you presently have. These estimations take into account things such as the size of your house, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is necessary so the unit isn't too large-both or too little waste energy.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are less typical now than natural gas, however they can be useful in more remote regions where energies are more difficult to gain access to, and in colder environments since it provides more heat per BTU than other options. The installation cost will be lower, but energy costs will be greater, as much as 3 times higher than gas or electric furnaces. They require a storage tank on the instant property and more maintenance. Overall, they cost between $2,000 and $8,000 to install. In general, they offer an AFUE score of in between 80 and 90 percent.<p>

<p>New air conditioning unit usually vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER score indicates greater energy efficiency and possibly lower energy costs.

It's not constantly about choosing the model with the highest SEER score, it's finding the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can help.<p>
