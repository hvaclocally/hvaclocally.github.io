<h3>Install New Air Conditioner in Lostant Illinois</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
