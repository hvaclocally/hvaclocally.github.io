<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in San Anselmo CA</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any area to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of undesirable smells and excessive moisture, presents outside air, keeps interior building air circulating, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
