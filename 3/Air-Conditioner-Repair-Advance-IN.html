If the symptoms fade or go away when a person is far from the home and return when the individual returns, an effort should be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging direct exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is improperly removed from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood floor joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and last floor finish. This is normally used in a third-floor or second location and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
