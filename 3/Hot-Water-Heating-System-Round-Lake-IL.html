<p>Inspect these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in the house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the issue.<p>
