Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

The also immediately followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
