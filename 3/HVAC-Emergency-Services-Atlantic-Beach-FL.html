<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor at Atlantic Beach FL</h3>
<p>BGE HOME can help you select your next high-efficiency heating and a/c system. From heating systems to heatpump, air conditioning system or boilers, we've got everything you need to keep your family comfy. For more information about heating and cooling systems, call us today. Your convenience is our primary top priority, and we can assist to make sure that you purchase the heating and a/c system that's right for your house and budget.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
