<p>Self-installation tends to create more issues than it fixes. In fact, it frequently triggers professional intervention anyway to fix a few of the issues that were created during the installation.

Let G & S Heating Cooling & Electric handle the whole HVAC installation process from the beginning, and you'll never have to stress over it being done improperly.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
