<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
